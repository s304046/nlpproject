And though I'll be lonely living for only yesterday I'll get along
Lemon crunch on her inkberry
Sign autographs, respect to accept it
All right, listen... We gotta get down to the lower decks, okay?
Every politician who has a dubious past.
Like a whirlwind Like a whirlwind
Odd accounts of where I've been
Of everything you wanted to say
This is no place for the young man
He's gonna put it down.
Will decrease when I step into your scenarios
Grandmother saved paper to use next year
And a partridge in a pear tree!
That time is good and gone
I know the struggle's hard but you gotta keep fighting gotta keep going on
Ya baby, Ya baby, Force dawn, crystal, Ya baby, Force dawn, crystal
And call your name, will you remember mine?
I'll never let it go
Little lies and massive dreams
I've been trying to talk to you.
'Cause you're invited to a wedding and to share the dream
But baby that ain't a crime oh yeah
I think I got too comfortable
No one will go twice,
But I just kick jams
If you give it time
Find me out on a mountain top
Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice in side my head!
Nowadays everybody knows how to get fresh
Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
You're looking at the numbers you've painted.
Don't you ever get tired of hurtin' me
If you and I can compromise
If music brought us here
I'm the one who pushed the swing.
What you mean you ain't nasty
And become another statistic for the rest of us to hear
Go and get the old man's jacket, will you?
You know you must believe me, it's so good to see you here.
He's out, he's safe, he's out!
Cock a rock hammer, nights gang bang, pull out and bang bang
The Beatles met the Queen, and I wrote
Ay yo Rae I got this
I'm screamin' fuck them other nights 'cause I'm down for my nights
Now I don't see you no more, no, I don't see you no more
Yeah, Travis on the Drums
A toothless bitch to blow him for a vile of crack
I'm the girl who's gonna make the dub.
Floating upstairs with a kiss in mind
Hop in the truck framed out
And when they light up our town I just think
We're looking for a sign here.
When he came to read my rights
And levitate heavyweight nigger like they was featherweight
Saying, Throw me somethin', Mister, please
Maybe I'm not good, but I can try.
Do your thoughts begin to wander
You say this love will see another day
Birded murders with a burn gushing a peasantry
It was all that and more
In love pool eyes float feathers after the struggle.
It's either cherry red or red.
I couldn't ask for more
And she came in the bathroom here and, see--
Yeah, yeah, you know how me and you do
And you wouldn't let it go
I can hear the leavin' train.
I'm begging you for mercy
I'll be working all day.
Stay hungry, feel the fire
The plane is on fire, the fucking ship is sinking.
And you can move like I've never seen
I come with new shit and have em like what's that
Grand delusions of petty criminals if I'm not everything I'm nothing at all
Said the world's in a rush, but he waited to be perfect.
I've been left with nothin'
You're all that I've been thinking of
Riding on the train, I'mma whip a Benz in the rain
You know, taken out of context I must seem so strange
I'm sure they've missed the whole place.
You give all new meaning to the same crap
No one shall live- only death is real
Wanting to squab with your homie over a bitch
Girl watch how its gon' drive you crazy
And fuck the po'- po', night keep a fo'- fo'
Then I'll take care of you
Got females that do lick, and some that strictly do dick
Who do boys like they're girls
Got behind close doors, it went down on site
I'm not so laid back that I wouldn't try... Nothing Is Wrong
Thinkin' bout things and what I left behind
Yea, your man got a gate, but he ain't busting no slug
Take a walk on the wild side of life, of life
The army's on way the army's on way
Amazing Grace is the song I sing
I drown in an ocean of perfume
Now she's married to that guy.
Both men turned as the 707 lit off its engines.
But I didn't listen back then
Oh, my God, I missed you!
I went a little bit below her belly ring
I'm dying in a damn beehive
And I wonder where you are
When the morning sun arrives then we'll decide if I should stay or go
You can listen to the engine
I been staring at you, shanty, all goddamn night!
Lifting up off the ground
You feel like my heart is beating.
My definition is high, I thinks its blue ray
Well you can celebrate anything you want
When I got back, I found a hole under my vault, all the way to the sewer.
If they knew who I was.
She's got the cosmic horn
Not watch someone's blood just spill out
When you cross the line, it's over.
So I walk in the sun in my rain hat and overcoat
Land of the weird, home of the strange.
Cowards whine beyond the olden gate
You will lose everything.
And we can have a chat, and I can show you...
Ain't nobody's business if I do
Am I the only night still care about mistakes
Take off your sister's new brassiere.
We got our hearts dipped in time release
To be so far away from perfect, that's all I've ever known
Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
They simply started over, when an error was made.
How hard it will be to come back
And our eyes gazed in foam beer goggles
Deeper and deeper you fall in a trance
As far as senseless, brutal deaths go, I'd say it went beautifully.
But now you- and not her- are the real hard.
If I could take all the anger and the hate a just give it right back to where it came from
If you don't like what you see
She's not your friend, that girl
Powers are enlarged, their powers and their follies have become fantastic.
I'll keep my hair fixed, keep rocking the hottest outfits
Hey, um... This side is missing a stripe.
Fourth behind my body is my soul
In the morning, he will search these ruins.
Wow, know how to all night long
And no one saw the pain inside
Top down, put the sun on bitches
And I really don't see why it happened to me. Wasn't there a better way an other day?
Like you're floating down a river scared there's a waterfall
That you are my everything you are everything
I'm never hidin' this light away
Amongst all these fuckin' shellfish...
How you want it? How do you want it?
This will be the last time, This will be the last time
We caught the outlaws and took them back to jail
Ran into a rainstorm, I ducked back into a bar door
Bad bad boy, a bad bad boy,
Don't you think it's time we think about you and me?
So Like A Dyke With Hollow Tits I'll Rip The Mike With Hollow Tips

No one you can trust
Well I get paid every 24 hours money and the power

When I can see myself again
Like busy sexual and do it all illegal
And I break down, yeah I want to die,
I've got them candy kisses on my mind
And I ain't over it yet
Slowly I'm falling more in love with you
I'm a jester in your dramas whimpering for your affection
But I don't think that we're gonna go.
You gotta hit the road
But to say that I've lost you
Gonna dance like nobody's watching

Dream of Horses, Dream of Horses
For the gift, and the giver.
Yo, I be the Moses takin poses

Sand in my hand ooh

But your face is a kiss of Judah.
Dim the lights and hang up the phone
But things are gonna heal again
No one will stop you.
I've moved along, packed up my shit
You're just on the edge, I think you're breaking
On summer nights like a sauna
It said our family fortune lies within our hearts
My bind will suck you... In
If you want my love, well that's how it's gotta be noah
Three billion lives would vanish in an instant.
I'm just a plant, I'm a plant.
And the air is thin
So much for happy endings
When we danced she held me tight
Can you see.. The pride of the panther
When you call my name call my name

I want to be the man who loves you
You know you're not gonna be able to do it.
Start with a light fair if needed.
I've tried to make it look like it wasn't a question.
'Cause you can say what is, or fight for it
I was a giant in the hood passing rocks to LT
Who will pick them up?
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer Watch how I'ma kill em
I noticed that your ass too big for your draws
i'm up in the swish house
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
You're talkin' dirty to me,
Well all right, well okay x
I said the other side of crazy
Two bucks on a 63 check.
Not only are you a cheat... you're a gutless cheat as well.
I gonna bide my time
I knew you were the only frog for me
Shorty trying take control of me got me saying damn
Teach me how to, teach me how to, teach me how to jerk
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town don't take your love to town
My brother keeper, with the mother load
Was no one there to receive him? Lord Gilbert, for example?
You don't have to be tall.
Tonight I want to love you
This phone call is seducing you, my voice is like SWEET Medusa
You want what you can't
Got, was hab ice blow gean,
Oh, oh, oh, building a fire
Oh, the one that you gave me anytime we were face to face
Baby don't go, you got the wrong idea
But I'll be back to do another show now
Open it, open it!
Yeah, give me the power It's the beginnin', the beginnin' of another day.
Be fearless just like the Scorpios
Can't stop this course we've plotted, oh yeah
One minute until gravitational pull is 100.
They want to see us, Bitches they want to be us
You wake up late for school, man you don't want to go
Even when I was signed
What's next got my mind on some group sex
Is that your shape in the foam of the sea
But you better give it to her
I'm bout gangster shit, and hoes know I'm working with something
You looked around and it wasn't there
Still after all this time
I'll take the poison and spit it out.
Speaking my name to try to confuse me
I guess I'm saying you're the only one
And in the distance is the sound of your guitar
I'm not interested in any love book.
Sugardaddy's blowing kisses from his gun
Or better yet, maybe, a pot roast?
You've decimated the team in the space of 24 hours.
So, don't get too discouraged in this life,
This one says... 'Peter and Juliet's Wedding'.
If you ain't runnin' game
And you don't like what you're going through
I'm looking for that girl with angel wings
And every time you hold me
When I'm like Popeye, I'm like Cap' Kirk.
Kneeling at the hotel reception
I have signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours.
He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom,
I'll give you my love
At half- past twelve the train stopped at Benares.
Te pares let me love you
I'd like to take you home to your villa now, if you'll permit me.
You smiled so coy and you moved in slowly
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
Now that the dream is gone, developed, disguised
In every town now, all around
Tonight, all you gotta do is watch the other singers and do what they do.
But it's not necessary to say goodbye to me.
Hey what were ya thinking
When you leave, I beg you to stay.
That's why I'm moving on.
She'd slave away all day until dinner was ready,
Girl I'm just bein' honest
I want to leave this town
I don't like it here anymore
You'll only remember what you want to forget.
So fucking cheap is everything
Just soft boiled eggs in shirts and ties
Now I've got so much to say, so much to do
The tides are turning now
You get the best of me
Will he bring me some toys like the other girls and boys
But she moves like I want.
I don't know where you're going.
I hear the phone, it rings so violently
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
There are the ones who sweep away your past
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone
You realize it's never gonna be the way it was
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Now all through high school I relied on drug- smuggling
Hey, I'm going to fall, I'm gonna fall.
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't.
It's your first time at a school like this, right?
Oh baby, makes me feel so fine
And you were laughing circling the road block
I'm guessing the sound of the bound.
Keep ya where your worst nightmare snuck in
So pour a shot in my glass and I'll forget forever! Forever
A paradise untouched by man
Oh baby let me breath
Crawling alone through the soot and stone,
Sweet and somber pigeon wings
I'd be gay if I loved Shaggy.
Struggle is perfect. All that is here is for good
The heavy heat gettin' out of hand
Blinded by love and misery
You can keep your bankroll, I want control of my soul
Coffee pots, and bottle tops
I'm gonna hold you here and I'll be happy.
I've been feeling you all this time
I was in love with the Stones, no satisfaction
Why don't they just let me live Why
We will rest in peace
Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
As a quiver of quivers, I'm quivering.
With the sunlight in her hair.
I don't know how to say goodbye
I was with the cops today and I went up to the lake.
Don't know how much more I can stand
For trying to sleep on the beach all night
Everything in life is small.
I've got them candy kisses on my mind
My nose was too close to see
You used to be so kind to me at first
And did a real thing didn't we?
Or question what it means
You're gonna be just fine
But he's not alone with the fairies.
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
I'm a refugee, and I'm taking it on myself.
Truly just check the suicide doors
Nowhere to run wound up way too tight
The hunt is on, your life is gone.
Damn that shit fun aye
Red lips, blue eyes and sweet disguise
Gaze locked on the biscuits, Orson whined longingly.
I did it all for you
Left foot, right foot, one, two, one, two,
Tell him I love him look him in the eye
A real night gonna do whatever he has to
I take a little white pill.
Then tell a soul, here's something on your plate
I never slipped yo I got my grip like a handle
Well I'm happy in November
If you didn't know me then, Guaranteed you know me now...
Now I'm going to take you, but I know the.
We have a world war undefeated champion.
Knowing that I got her back with what's important
Lights are flashing and its crystal clear
I'm talking to Robbie right now.
Man I was beat, I was driven by the heat
Clinton Sparks it. Mike poster- IDKurName
And we should be apart, now it's over like a holiday
The boy put his money down, 45
Where was that masked body
Flowin' behind the preacher's fiery eyes
It brought an end to me and you
Of these want- to- be's, nights they gonna see.
The warmth of a cold floor
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
So just for a little bit, baby
Why you always all on my back?
Back that ass up, wine go down
Homie they gon' lock me up, I'm still gon' make it to the top night
I'll bring the end to your claw
Broken hearted, it ain't a lotta fun
I traveled 'round the world to find the sun.
So many things I wanna know
You're something, but you don't have.
A black- haired girl I called Abilene
Begin my ascent to the sky.
You can only release him to you.
I didn't have the heart
Break that bitch down and peel of the first layer
You make a Ninja wanna fuck, bitch, you make a Ninja wanna fuck
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness... Darkness...
And drop the somethin' somethin' on me...
You're never gonna sell crack when you're resting.
The count is three and two
Nights think this swish Sweet
Put your hands on my body.
'bout any girl like I feel for you
Hale, in heaven there's a hell of a lot of heaven.
Iceberg- 5- where you at??
Timberland snow boots, collecting more CREAM than a toll booth
When they tell you.
Lost like a voiceless troubadour
Blood exploded outward as a coruscating wave engulfed the hapless creature.
Why must the summer always turn into the fall?
Why can't you see it, girl
The birthday girl is out of control,
it's the best game you can name!
To live a life with you
Under my hat, I'm in the range.
You were made for me no more party.. Baby
So now my soul's in debt, I must regret
From a crush of blushing brides- to- be
You my babe, I got my eyes on you
that's like my uncle getting approved for credit
Hit up the start line
You're gonna play his game,
Cause your gonna keep it hid
You'll do nothing but get married and make noise in bed.
Thought I'd introduce you to a couple of people.
You've got to believe in yourself, you know you are
All you ever do is make mistakes
No, she don't mess around
And the wind hits my sails
Though I've been playing prince tonight the castle isn't mine
If only you'd come back around
Come on sloppy, come on sloppy
O hear the angel voices
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
I'm looking for a false lift, so I'm here.
I ads, I ads a ballroom blitz I ads, I ads a ballroom blitz
We're pulling strings, killing kings
I know, I know, I know, we can make it
Each day I make a stand
You've got to show her you love her, morning and night,
Do you read what they're saying about you?
I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song
If you want, you can do it.
Look at my cheeseburger ass
Has it turned from a lifestyle to a fucking trend?
So don't let your stars go grey
And I think I am too weak to hold on,
When the only thing you want is
I don't know which way should I choose?
I could go cruisin' but I've had enough
From sunrise to sunset since the day I was born.
And he pulled the rebels to the ground.
While he's out dining A La Carte
What do you get when you fall in love?
I couldn't take much more of you
You're gonna last, and you're gonna be.
It's that once, your once
Three little kids for the flavor, stir carefully through the days
Without notes in tune with the time that surrounds.
And play the Texas boy who plays the game.
And I'll never let you go
When I wake up early in the morning
It's a dirty job but someones gotta do it
We are civilized and free from all confusion
Gently knocking at our door
Down- down like you, down- down like you, down- down like you
You're making this way to mathematical
The sickest part of the species.
Oh I got nothing left to say from this day on
Yes, but you should know he likes you.
There was a framed diagram of the human voice mechanism directly over Pierce s work desk.
On and on, reckless abandon
I'll never give up rep in New York, I'm true to it
I thought it would be easy
Don't know what to call that
Cause boy its in my nature
There is a war going on for your mind
Never fuck with these herbs
When you've forgotten me I'll remember you
They say that I should leave him alone, let him be
And still got bills and employees to pay.
But I can't tell the difference
Too much time on the battle line
Or his short little piggy fingers
According to the husband, the wife's a real witch.
We live in the same building, but we got different views
Calm the storm, calm the storm
The whole world is shaking now, I can feel it
And you can't find your car
Like the rain falls to the dry ground
Yo, because nothing is coming from it
Keep your praise, keep your praise.
In the good one us
I got that, I got that, I got that milk
Something for the ear so chill
Bring me my arrows of desire!
For one whole week, he's eating nothing but cheese. Yeah.
A little boy tugged gently
No one hear's, but me, your memories.
And now he's gone and it serves me right
There were airy filaments, pale blue and ivory and scarlet, that hung from rotting limbs like tattered lacework.
Ok, I'll see your 50 and I'll raise you...
In the forest animals may make that noise.
Every time you go away, I always say
They see us they hatin'
Why should the devil have all the good music?
Growing up like the women from the exorcist
When they were running the thugs.
Head's full baby, but you can't stop taking it in
We'll see all we've been through you know it's true
Or will he lie under the clay?
He had no place else to go
Maybe not, play me not, say we not remote at all
You're gonna drag them down.
And cross your heart and hope to die May Queen
You stole my heart with just one look
Choose life, the way that it's true
When you have everything to lose.
I can say, I can say, is the something more that
It's way past midnight and you travel through the city
Ah one two, ah one two
When I'm down and feelin' sad, you always comfort me
That we knew ourselves in silence
How we'll have grown so far apart
Frank zappa guitar, piano, lead vocals
We know where we're going, uh
To lift us with him as he goes.
Two weeks, maybe three weeks of their product.
Baby, I want to rub your leg.
Led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.
Foreman... you're not missing a blue shoe, are you?
When the past is finally dead and gone
Condition aggravated, rigors, tooth disorder,
It carried me for miles
Freedom for a select few.
They won't help you through
You sent a shock right through me
All begin and end with me
Richard, there you are, sneaking in like that.
Things are gonna move pretty fast from here on.
You'll wait a long time for me.
It's been tearing me apart
Don't try to explain, I admit it's over my head
Who do you think you are?
Break this thing off clean and
What can I say what could I do
So hold me hold me in your arms
Make ya bald head like a bowling ball
I'll hold you here for a minute.
Sleep all week with the same old witch
Li, I drink first to show my respect
Man of the laws, the ever- broken laws
Now the good girl just can't be found
Finally I'm where, I'm suppose to be
You you you take my heart and shake it up
Tires tortured as he goes through the follow- through.
When they ask you what you're thinking of
I tell the do slow it down, 'cause this bitch is all that
So I tried to touch the sun
Perhaps in the morning they could have a clearheaded conversation.
Illustrate the difference between you and me
I never wanted the stars
No, we'll never let you go
I want a moment without an end. X
But of the racist institutions, simple minds belong
Better watch boy, where you be at cause I'm a hit at, three flat
Let's do the Ray Charles- ton
Now if you take me up
And you're probably an OK person, if only you had a job
We will make heaven a heaven.
Wish I had done things different then she'd have stayed
Even though i've tried so hard I do
I'm sailing on a new beginning.
As you, my dear, like you.
Every little bit gimme all that you got
I've made a husband of a lover.
Oh, what have you got to do to believe?
And now I'm on my way back home
Once around the stump, then twice across the ceiling,
Obviously you've forgotten...... Tang and...... Microwave ovens and...
And she swore that she never will see me again
You will never mind what I ever said before,
I'll tell you what I'm saying loud and clear.
Try me please don't, I'ma shot if he want
I get this feeling when I wake up late at night
I'm somethin' like sippin' on Dom perigon
Won't you come to me with you
You must be haunting me
Lit below and burning white
Living every moment like it was your last
Even my hood call me baby Malcolm X
Till it happens to you
Collide like a head on
If you're going to tempt me, I'm not friendly, I'm a fool.
I'm changing my life for the girl tonight.
And I don't know the reason why noon
I really really really really really really like you
Run a mile, run a mile to the river
And I'll bet when they see me cry, they think it's just an act
You're the one I need
The sooner that you know, the sooner the shit flows
She keep claiming she drunk, baby blame it on us
There's a little boy at our house who's as happy as can be
Pretty young lady, driving me crazy
Ooh.. Let the music free up your mind
I'm gonna have a skin on my face with the same nights.
Call me Pharaoh cause I'm floatin' busts up the river
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.
I seen the beast take life and say he had a knife
Lonely as an angel in a Godless sky
You think that will protect her from the rain
Because it's the last time.
But you might as well stay, there's no limit to the sky
That you know will be waiting
Your crew fell, you jail 'cause mine down it
But I believe I might have told you so
Gang rape revving engines overheating boiling up exposed and bleeding little boy
And we don't have much time
And after all this time, to find we're just like all the rest
Together we can come for the world, I need to know
Ever since I've been outside, I've never been inside.
Can only be quenched by our freedom's desire!
'Til I hit the main line in that cell confined
Stand or fall I know there
This is the free food that you missed?
You're more beautiful than ever
He on give it to ya
Suga's slimy bitch and his bitch.
The glory of this imperfection
I sure hope there ain't beer in them cups
Hes black and hes famous
Let me tell you now
32 karats on the cross, no flaws.
The plaice play the bass
And under covers you my muthafucka night,
I'm not gonna have a handle or a handle.
But I Ain't Got Nothin' That You Can Use
When folks I known for years, that couldn't pronounce my name
This what it's all about right?
And it's long hard road we've known
They ask me arhus, could things be any tougher?
We got the buzz and the want you, baby, all we need is a little more time
Melodies were kind of rough but you knew they came from the heart
When I'm thinking of all the suffering.
Dad came from Detroit and he took me.
A ragged band they called the Diggers came to show the people's will
But that doesn't mean anything has changed
It's my opinion that something I didn't do.
Pain like the rain that's falling
High powered on my way to the west side
My family's pictures in the house where I was born.
When you're doin' things in your way
Pat, Boy Scouts, Little League...... The works.
She couldn't make another day
When we're learning to forgive the hardest part?
There ain't no losers over here
You see I'm not Incomprehensible take you there
I fell asleep in the living room
Bitches all in the spot go head and get your fun on
She hasn't made a call, she must be thinking it over
You say you gotta burn to shine
Build me up, build me up
A room full of real live genuine rednecks
I lost my heart to a meat hook
I wanna relax and be tender.
They only gave me Louisville.
A faded star and an angel without wings,
That is a fucking chance I'm gonna take. Understand me?
Sugar sugar how you get so fly?
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
On the day of the hakka, the day of the hakka.
And I smoked a lot of cigarettes
What we could have been.
Cos mums are supposed to think their kids are nice.
Make that ass clap overtime that I hit it
Walk along with me, come on, don't tease me
It's just another song about missing you
Activate self- destruct, elimination is imminent
Tell me, tell me it's addicted to the same love
I might be here with you
The roof where we've seen the show.
In one of his ears, a tiny speaker has been surgically implanted.
I'd say something went wrong in our lives
Freedom, well it's a thing that is fleeting
... King without a woodman baby
In the stove, we keep fire burning, always.
In? T the world a crazy place?
Oh, it's not going to be like that.
Found dead on the road
Time immemorial, time immemorial, time.
I said, Who'll help me to forget?
And go and cop an island
Then fly 'em up to the spot a pile of dust
Feel it, Taste the victory
The chubbier, a man that came out about 1986
You don't have my first love.
And my days are ending
Send folk signals from the weed that we blow,
The last three days have been...
You're a woman and you drink beer.
She had no fear of death.
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Please don you self destruct tonight
We play our music like a storm
You're the only one I've ever loved, oh oh oh oh.
Oh, my God, it's a little bit of.
My car, my Hummer got 26 inch rims
That what you really really
And I'll tell you why
Fate could never keep you away from me
Every time I hear that song
Are you saying the same gun was used in all three shootings?
You cast the darkest shadow
I hadn't realized how much that fellow had been on my mind until now.
Don't look far 'cause I'll be gone.
That the first thing that come to my mind.
She labored so hard in this world below she didn't have things that most mothers know
It keeps me up, it keeps me tight
Well I'd be lying if I said that I didn't wanna tear it out
I got the world inside of my palm
And that makes one of us who can't give up
Nigger, I'm gonna have the juice.
Down and down, the youth descended
Let me know, babe, about my fortune
Girl you better tell em all
I tricked my my mind its true
This is what it sounds like
She's got a classic custom mustang
Your hands on the wheel and your hair out the window
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
I'm the first kiss of my life chi.
The reasons that I loved you
I wonder what I could say
So after all what's this life living for,
Somewhere in that Wyoming wind
We tried to get it right
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall
And to the earth it gave great light
When I'm through nights, they never ask who the fuck you are.
Hence, additional efforts will be needed for Member States to stay on track in the forthcoming years.
Got to keep on plodding onward with your precious load
Where there's a music should be comin' out of every car
How can I love you when you don't have a soul?
My wing span can and will employ full expansion
It ain't a problem, I can picture us
Come and stay a while
No rob, we'll fix it in the mix
But all in love is fair
Ya hips ya thigh ya whole demeanor
Broken and desperate before Her Orphaned Throne
Black and blue, battered and bruised
We are alive because You died
Until I hear sirens, I'm gone with the wind
It's gonna get ya yeah, yeah, yeah
He was someone that you could talk to
I'mma see you when I see you any day
I'm no good to anyone after loving you
I'd like to have a little love on the balcony tonight.
You wouldn't see me again.
Their own need for deception
I'm thinking of love forever.
Baby you'll be out of your mind,
Nothing here you can pick apart
The floor manager is your best of friends
Such a boring story... who's gonna go see this!
So say what you want me to say
You are red in a sea of black and white
I'm the one who's responsible for everything.
Is it a sure- fire way to speed things up
Don't let me down, please.
I have the strength to endure because, because
The world is burning in your hands
Standing on your shoulders I can touch the sky
You and me, you and me, you and me
We might never go if none else is watching us
Where our eyes are never closing
Nice so precise with a hip- hop update
But you're the only sure thing that I've found
You know who I'm really like.
When you hear the song,
And you're better than me at football and my job
If it was anybody else but you
Then you shouldn't try to front
On the roof there is an airconditioning unit which provides reliable air- condition of entire complex.
I feel your heart is turned to stone
In your fear where you lay
Had a vision of the ruby sky we were riding high
Even your mama want my autograph
The timings right, are you satisfied
I don't want bad luck and trouble
Case they have to pop one
Nights getting one deal in six months they poor
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
But there's nothin' I can do
Outside you draw, draw yourself
You'll spend your last heartbeat chasing after rainbows
Or wait to get on the plane
Then last sunday, you choked the life out of her.
It's time to be a man now
There is no reason for you to hide
I've marked you as a lonely page.
Check the Bible for a honest diagnosis
They don't wanna see me shine.
He steppin' out with the older boys
Dope, I smoke it but not everyday
I could dance all night, I could shake with delight,
We're gonna go where we can shine
Shell sweetie, ask my night b needle
Nobody can deny that there's something there
Fuck you if you ain't fuckin' with me
Leave the dust on this street.
Chasing the sun back to the West Coast
Come on, Come on, into my arms
I'm gonna give you more.
Never been such a fool for love
Rings fly, you my wife
I'm interested in giving you more than the next guy.
Who's the one who's got the house?
Cush is in the inside, pull me over
Took a rich prissy bitch and played her this and made her gutta'
Like home between the cheeks
The amount requested for communication tools, if any
Where you thought you could fly
I'll stake out the Heritage Center when we're done with Professor solar.
When you're making money, don't forget them.
Yes, and if I could hear her heart a- softly poundin',
You've got somebody who will spend some time with you baby
And it feels like I'll never smile again
Where the big deal this cowboy gear sewn in Japan?
He ain't nuthin' but a thug
We don't need to get it right
And all the cool kids in the back of the bus
You have a shower, some grub, grab some sack time.
You know what you gotta do
You was the pimp of all panderers
Here in our little world, the tiny world spins for me
Keep the information out of the cover.
But your white dress, gold band, silver frame and photograph
Where do you want to go now?
But when I looked away
If you keep swinging that knife
We, who gets conflict, must just be weak, it's gettin' clearer
Your arms are open for me
Evidently he'd gone to some other chamber within the building.
All I want in this life of mine
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Then some dude came down to touch the Mother
I just know what to say
The ghetto's a mind, body and soul.
I'm just not giving it to you.
If you bring that don't make you stop
For the proof, look me straight in the eye.
The use of TAOs was therefore phased out.
Come out the elevator- k- tone, like night what?
I'm digging in the cold ground like crazy.
It's so hard, to be let down Let down baby
Bitch I got El chap on the other line
Will ever take its place
I'm everything you've said to me
I'mma get 'em get 'em so come hit the repeat
Don't forget I'm looking at you.
And someone has to be to blame.
Living in a world of laws.
Try to wrong my rights, try to right my wrongs
What a rush she's rocking me slow
The hoot of an owl the puppy dogs' growl
Screamed out for help but you were gone too far
All this time, you were protecting me.
'Cause what's a kiss? A kiss is a kiss
But I'm caught in your after shock
I can't get after someone else, none of these weak bitches
It's the right time to let it roll
Now I'm thinking about us.
In the back of the class that you thought was gay
Two hearts beating, to keep the fire alive.
'cause there ain't nothing wrong with a good shake at.
And all my jury is expensive
Cant.. Cant swam cant...
To change slow your ways still
He was feeling more confident now as he increased the distance between himself and his pursuers.
While we're brave enough to care
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Dressed in black and we're singing along, to the
Are ya ready for me
Maybe I'm just dreaming.
Igniting the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
To catch me and hang me
Except the closer you get, the better you look
You're like Jordan's on Saturday,
A ring around the waitress from the verse
But something's holding you down.
I guess that I need time
House what do you want another one for?
I'll build my own world.
Only if we're united, do we stand a chance against them.
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
You got to rewind every one of my lines,
Well! Said Joe, so much the worse for these natives.

Another A big, broad- eyed fish.
Only the devil is stopping me from eating swine
Don't forget whose child you are
Like a sea of flames
Victoria had finally let me in on her secret.
I'm too tired with my soul stripped bare
Are you upset with me for some reason?
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
'Cause you filled it with fucking alcohol
Usurping very rapidly the position of the G,
Hustling them E's and that C's and that H
But as immovable as a mountain, and it is dark all around.
It's so hard to find you.
To say how funny you are
So now's the time to fight for our beliefs
Caught up outside the light
You add those five cars that you picked up...
In the time my dad's at work and before he came back
But now, I think I'm ready for love
For the things that I have done
There's only one thing on my mind
I've got all my money
And when I say shone,
So hate it if you must, but I made it and you can trust
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck
Rule the black bishop over the world like a guided missile
Many times I've faced my death with no one to know.
For all we know, said John Paul, the Chinese have an operation ready to roll.
While so many innocent die
Hope for my wish, the waves of a parting sea
Cause you know I'll want to die.
Look at you, you sorry ass, low- down raggedy bitch
They crawl from the oceans to paint in the caves
Should have killed it from birth
This ain't no gangsta song for you to sing along
I wish I could be seeing you tonight
Oh boy you should have thought about that before
There's a rumor, there's a rumor
You pay the price.
In the Kingdom of campania if one doesn't waltz...... One doesn't dance.
Girl you really ought to think about it
I've hurt you, and I wish to go on hurting you.
To never even give a little piece of me.
She holds it for me in reserve
He's well hung and I am hanging on
Never going to let go...
Tall as a fucking rail.
You know I'm really good at it.
I have the desire and soul to go.
Where it's still fuck the police, white and black cop
So me and my girls headed
Lookin' back on what I've done
It's hard to pin me down that way
I'll find a way to make it last
Baby, what do I do to make it right
Bitch with me big titties and a small waist
The more that we discover
When loved ones are near.
Stories that would make your eyes
Gripped by despair so cruel
Take me in, into your darkest hour
We've been talking bout Jackson ever since the fire went out
And it's going and it's going and it's going and it's
Say that you're gonna go
Or had been back again, in these most recent days.
Close up, the shale pieces looks rather lovely.
It could all go back
There is something going on
Why should I feel this way
A Heart of gold losing only all he can be
Didn't know I loved her till they laid her down
And we got to work it out alone.
Nah, this ain't make belief, I'ma make you believe
Say why you re so hold and fly
Was one of them relationships where nobody smiles
Make me get the strap And then do something else
And death will be my final lover
You don't, you don't want these problems I tell em, you don't want these problems
'Cause a big bit of nothing don't take blues away
The magic of your hand on the drum
Put a bullet in the clip and come get ya ass
Drove 35 miles outside of town
How can something so bad feel so good?
And I've learned that my loving husband is my husband.
I suppose, can you bring him back?
With love, from me to you
Shake it baby, get on it x
I'll be coming home next year
I need a chick to be kinda dope
You know, Your Highness, you really must let me give you a party.

To walk from the darkness
Wrong or right, you held me up to the light
3 4, Bogyoke St., Pyinmana, Mandalay Division monica
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Is there anyone at home?
Just painting a picture for me
In the silk of her thighs, in the hinge of her thighs.
You're facing a crime that's.
We hear Your voice cut through the darkness
The time is now a'come
Putting a bubble on the wall.
This is the story of the young heart
Make me a happy home
We're gonna be a real millionaire jackass.

They remind me of the stupid things I've done
Up laid in they tomb
Oh, just another good girl gone bad, I guess.

Brought together by a movement and a sense of tradition the strong will survive.
And last night I had trouble sleeping
What do you want? Quiet money for the rest of your life I'm not interested
No one knows him, and no one cares.

I would find a way around the flame forests if necessary.
One- hundred percent pure shit, uncut.
We've been snowing in the city in the summer.
From the dust a new person will be created.
Correctly connecting, craniums crumble down
I am intrigued by the evermore, said vulgar.
Never been the one to hurt me
I guess it's up to me to save this family, then.
I'm beginning to doubt the bad world I live in.
I have money, and I'm going to go.
I have to stay out of sight.
I'd like to call it a night, but I can't.

I said I touch the world and the world said
We watch the white horse run
Hey, you've got a cousin in the limo business, don't you?
But I knew she would
I'm gonna man up and tough it out

The moment I leave his side
I got into a beef now my friend is deceased
But in the meantime...- You are not searching my room without me there.
Wander like I just don't care

See here lives a bitch and bitches come and they go

When we have wished upon a backstair
I tried these lines, I tried...
Unless I decide to step inside of that came

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow

I didn't see the magazine, I didn't see the to.
Oh, my God, I'm going to do it with a knife in my mouth.

But I can't begin to even imagine,
But still, I don't stop to the beat
I used to go out to parties and stand around
'cause I saw you sitting in the rain with the tears running down, running down your face
Might valet park a Brinks truck
I chew the thorn when midnight gets too long
I couldn't say you didn't warn me
Who said you don't come around anymore

And find some new songs to listen to
So break this cup 'cause something might happen
Flood you can't hide, lil' boy

When I heard the news, I was laughing.
A night think this is a disease, can't even keep it a 100
The peace in my mind is drowning, fading down
With the last farewell, this long goodbye.
But had the same meaning
You made me want you
My love will guide you

You want to go wherever you want.
You've always been so warm and calculated I owe you a thanks
You can copy but it's only goin' be one me
Suddenly easy to contemplate why, why
The same old eyes but not the shine.
I'm still hung up on you
She is such an integral part of me
Could tell by the way she walked
Magic in his smile on his lips
Wishing its a bad dream cause usually never happens to yah.
But you can't go in there, but you can.
And a very exciting girl

Because I'm the one who's got the block.
Wanted me to be the only one
Because you're all I have, my boy
I didn't become a musician
As you lie naked in the dark sunshine
And it would take a strong, strong wind
How bout a fast brunch
I'm struggling to feed this hunger.
I gotta let you know not the one
He don't need the power
How precious did that grace appear
And I just can't go on, if you won't see me,
To the hood, parked crooked behind that chained fence
So that's where I've been drinking
Out of my window, I see a picture
When I was a kid, I was a little.
If you are a friend of mine
Do you wanna, I was thinkin', would you care.
But love and hate cannot come go oh so quick
Okay, okay, everybody looks very nice today.

With your telescope eyes, metal teeth
One in Russia, one in China
Yeah, I'm having it all, your black summer
But we wont come inside when Grace calls our name
And I'm not doing this alone
In the name of love!
Ride for ruin...... And the world's ending!
Lightning bolt strikes the horizon
But I'm the one that's getting hurt.

And if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up
Get the crash crew here. Our helicopter's going down.
Spark it up and numb me on and off again

Just over the edge and I won't be scared.
When you knew they were all that I had left, nothing left
We can change the world
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade
Ln the meantime... Maybe you can call some friends or family, stay with them.
We're not gonna stop giving it all.
And if you escape, you better swim fast
I think I'd lie for you
I wanna be the one your kissing and hugging
But we don't have to go through the trial.
All I got on my mind is you
To see Was Pouring Like Fountains I'm Drowning With Twenty stasis
But my pride wouldn't let me dial.
They're not rich, but they have a lot of love in the house.
So why you gotta act a fool tonight
We're just glad we're here.
He might be able to drown the portion of his mind
Can't take the weight and I can't take the strain
'Cause tonight it's goin' down
It's been so long darling I just wonder if you really realize

In my champagne glass, you know.
You drink wine, you make your ass move.

And the old you's dead, really.
And I know it in my heart
Son of a bitch! Damn it, Chris, I called that from upstairs!
And asked him would you like to die?
And she said I've been hitting pussy like nobody.
Just like they did for me
Never heard of a plan so stupid.
I hate to hear me own voice, believe it or not.
That tear at our backs like thistle down
So far at least until tomorrow
Don't blow my hide just blow my guy
I feel fine, I'm gonna' shake it, Lou
I wish that you were candy. Wrap you with my body
To set this place aflame
So night fuck around and get cut like a canteloupe
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Maybe we'll find a reason for it.
Some rather die, then face a fate worse than hell

It's hard to take when love grows old.
She gives with every, every little breath of her beck and call
I can't get over you
All the joy of the house goes away with you, my friend.
Holly's in the window, home's where the wind blows
And I refused to quit
Your empty bed ain't no crystal ball
Now somebody has burned the car
And I'm indifferent to the loss
With her heart on her sleeve, once in a while you're
Don't try to help me with charity.
Bedrooms, bathrooms, bathrooms, other bathrooms, the swimming pool...
There it is a hope speech.
But for the guy who can t be seen
These ARE THE DARKEST OF MY DAYS
Remember when I asked you for the number.
Fuck flowin', I'm turning nigger into Jesse Owens
So what you know my first name is like Mark
Pull the arrows from your heart
And the soldiers that we hated were all dead or criminal
Don't let me get in the way of you.
He must find a place to be still
The world is changing- just look away
We can catch a matinée, if that's what you like
And I will not be afraid
Yes. Your power source had our organization puzzled for some time.
To the love that won't give up with you
I just gotta go halfway. The moon's gravity will do the rest.
Just hold on we're going home
It's a shame we can't always win
He slept through the night, you know, right away.
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up!
Throw me off my land, not
And you much fuck's still tryin' to calm me down,
It Is In The In between
Spit chorus, bitches can't ignore us
Oh what did I know?
I know exactly what I'm gonna do
That's when you turn away
This is how the city- folk and mole- people connect- next
Been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
But now I'm hearing all these words you say
I'm not sure what's going on. It could be nothing.
Until I'm in my bedroom.
Only on camera, only on camera
The good book, or even satan you see
Girl when we meet, you're a
She doesn't love you she's using you to show you off, to her friends,
I fell in love with the collie
I wind upon ya hip hip hip
I ain't got a lot
That kept me so close
I'm gonna be the best me
And see our shadows on the ground
If you don't like the company.
No one's attracted to me when I wear it.
I will run, I will fall, I will run to you.
Isn't an enclave supposed to have people?
Never one to say that I am just a little boy
I know you say that you're over me
There's nothing like a pink taco!
Understandable that tank would make a mistake in judgement, she meant.
Best shape of my life, I'm sick if it thug
White is the sheet on your fine linen bed
So when another die, don't blame the devil, blame that other guy
By a man who takes for granted all he has
Kinda magnificent, but always stayin' distant
The Captain and I will make a boat sea worthy, while you two gather supplies.
Losing faith, you're falling from
And if I do or die, I sing a lullaby
We're just 2 honks a negro
I stand in the wind.
The preacher shuts his eyes
Oh, those damn galaxies, they had to go and collapse!
I'm movin' faster than a Jimmy- 8
Like... We are going to be planning a wedding feast.
He's got a slow, slow ride
Are we allowed to make brand new beginnings?
Well, Mr slavic, are you gonna stay with the sinking ship?
When I do, I'm caught on
Two hearts that beat as one
Since I started eating my motto is eat away
When had quite the fight, me and my lovely wife
Love is everything, hate is smaller
I love her, she love me
Thinking oh that, baby, I was wrong
This love hasn't changed me
Ooh ooh the city's new the faces change
They'll feed you to the sharks.
Get out all your lovin' here tonight
You see that look in my eyes
No yes Yes yes Yes yes
Mwahahahahaha! Welcome, boys... Come right in.
I'm a dried- out, I'm a dried- out.
Minty we iron nae makeup tajik molly
Remember when everyone was on stage with the dos.
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And when I'm in some stranger's arms
Nothing can strike me in such awe
let's go rolling in a broken winnebago
In this company, Captain, I believe you're the one who stands out.
Get out of hand I ask you,
If I could disappear from where I came
All gas, no brakes, might break your face
Nigger don't want beef with me
And keep an eye out for any medical supplies, drugs in particular.
If you think I'm not respected, I'm sure you're right.
It's me now that they want
I feel like I'm a stranger in my own country.
Surely, the hand of God was visible here.
And the eternal things of God.
He's been home a lot of times, and he's not paid much.
I'm hiding it, but I'm not hiding it.
Well, I got me a couple tickets, take my baby to the game
When I'm waking up in the morning,
But I have given you all I had
It always seems no matter what I do
There one one wrong desire
When the waves of the sea die to the wind
I'm all alone now.
You've been gone too long, I'm waiting out the winter
Now you know we're on your side, so don't worry,
So save your scissors someone else's skin
Disarray, why feel for you
Daisy, it's 'Munk, I like this
Someday I'll stop my traveling
So take me by the hand I'm on my knees
I'm sure it's always been you.
Over expression and rationed, assimilated temptation
The horror of the killing and the thrill.
3- 4 leaves you dead on the floor
I'm not playing any of them, I'm not playing them.
We pay ourselves, we're on our white tee.
You were all I had
Only if you like rocking jazz
Clear blue 'em, day after pill den lose 'em, I got one
But I couldn't come in
I shall therefore turn to those matters after having set out my reasoning, which I consider should prevail, on admissibility.
Just look into my eyes
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
But I've always been good to you.
In your face come on get up
You are faithful, God, forever
I hear your name in the papers
I Can Rock Your Body
You are all my life
At my window with a broken wing
Hush, baby, you're talking too much.
Will continue a few days yet, a few days yet
Falling precious metal to suck out her soul
The industry don't mention my fucking name
The keepers of the ancient future
I send 'em 5 every month.- That is very generous...
You won't give me what I can't bear
You are the only God
It's such a strange strain on you
Mama she a sufferer, papa he a sufferer
This is it, all eyes on you
Seems to have misplaced his weaponry and armor
Baby lets kiss the sky
Well, the engine is just warming up.
So I took that green stuff and I chugged ten of em
And where does that leave me?
In a city far away
Getting a little bit of a tree around the apple.
An avenue of broken dreams
The sudden motion made me skip now we're into a brand knew trip
Seems that all I really was doing
Bright lights on the houses down the street
I'm still waiting, waiting Ah, ha, waiting
If that gat wasn't all up in yo face
Don't go, don't go away
And you're gonna make a hell of a coach.
I'm safe at the plate, take it away
The fact that you haven't remembered my birthday since I was 10. Huh. Well.
'Cuz I keep winning and these boys keep losing
He was crying for help, but he wanted to go.
Until I finally find you on the planet of love
Tensions so thick girl I can't wait
Like a sound that to the depths of the soul
Black, gold, hundred mill' off the floor
Sometimes I need you, honestly
That means I must be living it living it living it
Karen, may I see your blue eyes
Playin' anythin' I wanted to play
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Yeah, I know you, we from the same town and shit, but we ain't that deep
And I'll never be her
Uh, I'm out of my trance here and I am real high up.
Many lifetimes have passed in a instant reminded
When I'm in the zone, you'll throw your hands up.
I press start, here comes new challenger
There's a chance you can't deny
That drip drip drip is making me drink That drip drip drip is making me sick
I can't go anywhere without
Everybody's got to be together
I can't feel this way, so ordinary
Lunatic smoking loops, loose in your sector
Ill make amends with my exes
Now go but the soft drink
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
Read between the lines, they teach them to sing.
Nothing to do, nothing to say
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
My friend, IT'S BULLETS FOR YOU
I don't know much about you, not that I want to. Not that I want to.
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
He had such a short attention span
Things that rearrange our brains make us think insane
The miles that passed beneath us
Me I'll never be lonely
I see your pussy lip looking fat through them tight ass clothes
It's odd the way one can pyramid simple facts into wild fantasies, isn't it?
Crawling back to the womb
We'll stop being washed away.
You decide to believe it's too late for the way out.
50 cent clip the bye
I'm just flexing my watch.
One night I will be a star
Fate fell short this time
I still think about you
We'll see one day, and we'll see.
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Me nah go put no triple six inn mi head you must be mad
Spit flows rip shows peep the recital
Keep it out of sight
It's that time of the evening
That I just can't afford
And I'll share my horse, my hole, my wife.
So we gon' let everybody see your gangsta ass get smoked like a bitch
You've made me the way I'm like you.
We can go to the club or hide away
Just a minute, someone's beeping, might be him.
Do you think this is a game that anyone can play
I didn't lie to you.
And you go where you know you should go
You have poured out of grace
Sometime you just can't have it all
My dog gao is more popular, my gestures are like hypnosis
Perhaps this was an Olympic sport at which all Europeans ex cancelled, but someone led him to his room.
Make their livin' diggin' dirt.
They threaten to tear me all apart
Near misses on the dogleg stairways
I could learn to tame the clouds
With their hairy backs and five- o- clock shadow and those are just the women
You mean, all the car chases and stuff?
Was the blood on the floor and the love in your yell
And I've waited for her for so long
I'm turning left, 'cause I hear something.
I've always loved the love in New York.
But the world seems to be in a hurry.
As the song is sung, the galaxy is formed in less time than it takes to sing.
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
'Cause we got nobody else
But your heroes aren't what they seem
Off with my overcoat, off with my glove
When nothing you do can change my mind
Welcome home said the hot moonlight
In my American Apparel underwear
But she left me sorrow and fear of tomorrow
You rippin' the bone like me, can get it as long as me
An fixation a fix on anything the line of life the limb of a tree
Young night move that dope
Oh, sweet little sugar talker
We can all be scared to death
How could anybody say that dey the like I be
But then a voice says, bags that can't be stowed
Something I could look forward too
Now when she wants it she can't be denied
Who am I e. D. The green eyed bandit
I just hope you write your thesis
His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Turn away, find a way, your own
Their spirits aren't trapped anymore because of you.
And this was a test that was bigger than him
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
She said she would leave them alone, but I'm a skater.
And I will be your nights
I'm the general that your boy saluted
All the memories that we've made
I'm telling you, you're listening.
But, funny thing is we
There's nothing I can do
Baby ruff me up up up up up up up
I'm still interested, I care about her.
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God, my God,
We won't talk about the past
Did she really get that strong
Don't know if its wrong, don't know if it right, overtime I'm with you I feel brand new
And it's hard to turn a wrench on a rusty bolt
History is laughing at us
My bitches, my bitches don't post none of his bail
Can you see the thunder
Some of them want to be abused
Yeah, like down the street there is the Cambria Fight Club.
I want to show you it all, what to do and where and how
Bringing the drama for the masses
And everybody wanna live another life
And ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three two, one!
And I'm a grown woman
You're flipping over two symbols. The first round is going to take some luck to get a match.
I'll get you back someday
I want a guy in New York.
Excuse me, gunther, But somehow it does not work.
You've always known, which is great for you.
I'll take care of you.
I just want you to know
A rusted silhouette embracing burning filament
I'm thinking up something to say
She was here a minute ago.
What the world needs now
I wanna know when you're gonna come, see
I play my cards but somehow I can't win
And the nucleus of everyone has disappeared
So hold on for your life
And I feel so weighed down
How do I work this?
Got you wrapped up in my arms
Power- packed in black, to make you see mad graphics
So you need to just keep
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
The more I get to know you, the more my heart rings
They say the closest thing to freedom is livin' on the road
Yelling mo murder with the beam got lots of felons
I feel it back in my bones
Five girls next door, I'm up to my ears
Bleed, it's that night that kill 'em
I never could do that
My heart is all in tatters, I ain't nobody's saint.
Back to what I was talkin' 'bout
They're staying up for the rest of us.
Special Branch got their feelers out,
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, montero, pussy and flamingos
Tell me what you're feeling.
City living heavy trouble city living rough we are given angry hearts but
This is my opening, e coming at ya lazy style
God, how I wish that this dream would go on
Look, I've got urgent business to take care of, and...
Details can somehow slip your mind
Somebody taking away another part of me
Tic- to, running out of time
Just take a look at your body now,
I wish I could turn it around
Modern rap history is re- born on cd code in the form of a poem
Yes, I think you've been cheating on me
Try and take control of it
We're climbing, playing the game, and we're singing.
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried
Sharks smell the blood that I'm bleeding
I shape the wig like a woodblock
But I'll just keep my mouth shut
Well, uh, Darryl's case... Has already been decided, I'm sorry to say.
Listen for this reason, before it gets too late
It's life I have to chase
I just can't live without you, I miss ev'rything about you.
Or another paying dues day
There ain't no room for compromise, let your conscience be your guide
In the night, till the light
Catch a player leanin' imp- uh, one up in the trunk
To catch that drop of wine.
Go find a man that will obey
Went away but I'm not forgetting
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
You will be at my door
It's not who loves you as how much do you love
With a lead leg full of lead.
When I know it's time for me to go
She said, I'm not even talking to you anymore.
When the odds are sayin' you'll never win
Why you gotta make it so ha- hard on me?
With your head above the clouds
Everything is gone so young, you don't need me around
God, you're losing it, aren't you?
And you can have your trip
Why d'you always have to dance all night?
Once again have been put up for sale.
But I couldn't make you stop
The ringmaster calls you down
I have you covered from head to toe.
I hope your world stays rosy red the sky is blue above your head
Sour smoke out the nasal
I'm sure I'll be the world and more.
And no one to say it to
You said cities will fall
Biological technical message view with no point.
Loc'in like Tone, street nights get grown
Don't you tell me that it's over
I ain't talking bout the ape no night in this city come hang with me
Have you got my number?
Saving up to buy your freedom, are you?- No.
As the world belongs to me.
Blame it on the beat of the drum
Is there a way to see tomorrow
But you can't take my P. O with the metal flake
When the ice hit the light, it twinkle and glisten
We've taken a picture of the whole thing.
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
I've been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
They kept on wailin' windin' up the song
If lust is sin then what price our extinction?
Honey, just allow me one more chance
Right now, my... My sperm quality is at its peak, I'm told.
I choose to be me.
Stop it! You've got a girl dying in there.
You've taught us to claw.
Sky that seen daily is not true
Let's make this moment last
Well how do I know
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Keep in touch until the end.
I'm back on the road again.
You might have to go and find a party
On the bus and off the trampoline.
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
Bet she doesn't touch like me
Yeah, sounds like we're a bunch of chicken shits if you want my opinion.
it's been weeks since i've seen you
Follow- up by your doctor should be performed every 6 months.
Like candles in the street
There The Shepherds Bowed Their Heads
Ma call you out, ma call you out
I'll give you all that I got
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'llac
You're a man, but you don't see it.
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me. They be snapping, baby!
Well I marked eighty points and I won me the round
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
Don't let 'em get to you
I made this bed I'm crying on
I'm sure the heart is still there.
Cause this world is a whirlwind, but I'm holding that trapeze
To avoid transmitting the infection, mothers with his should not breast feed their babies.
No one else cares to hear the sound of Faith coming near
Remember the days when it's never going to end.
Take me I'm all the man you'll need
And I think it might be part of the Variables.
There's no going back when someone's ended a sentence with 'pray?'
Who cares if there's no improvement?
Street signs and swinging chairs
I buzzed your bell in, woman
Lost in my senses and I'm losing sight
Sure, it's definitely a hot mess!
I wont predict it myself!
Behind an open door there lies a million more
Baby, I can see us touchin' like that like that
Pull a trampoline, the way she's gonna jump on you slowly
We hang out by the bonfire
Happily for me, the cursed brutality of the man made me angry.
'cause you'll keep goin' crazy 'til your mind is gone
Well, I woke up a morning
All ain't ready all ain't ready come on now all ain't ready all ain't
Oh I- I wouldn't cheat on you
Yes, really, really, really, really, really
But who's the one who's missing a woman,
There isn't much more I can tell you at this point.
Young man, you too girlie girlie
My boys spread out, got their girls, and rapping
For all the lies you told
You're running away with my spoon.
You are always on my mind
Hey you, the jury members
For a while we had this dream we were innocent.
Say what you do for me than, I'm good
Hell yeah Can you feel the good vibes
And this fire is burning still
And I am sure without a doubt
I got a new girl
That I could go anytime
If you really, really wanna- ah, have a happy, happy, happy, happy
I spent too much time for one night
Out, ya'll come in, the money stays in the car 'till I say
Ln my eyes, that makes you a fool. A senile old fool!
don't you ever go this way
I'm here to save you.
And in your own dead indifferent way
Convincingly I can advance Dee, it's a prophecy
I face your face fade
Black! Black! Black! She's black.
That we won't be wastin' time tonight
Let's hope we've always summer
Love is stronger, love is stronger.
With every breath every step I take
That I'll be back sometime this time next year
The sweetest piece of lovin' any girl ever had
I've tried, to stay alive, in our bed, in our heads
I'll see you through me.
When he's down, he'll help you.
As I lay here by my woman I know I'm back where I belong again
Beyond this door, there's an arena for our hero.
I can breathe for the first time
I'm alive in your arms.
Blood sweating, hollering, your world wreckin'
Take a minute, choose the topic and let it go.
You're just way too much.
Lifting me, don't know how
And every day I play awake a night learnin' by haters
The woods are eating the woman.
Til' the rain pours through the ceiling
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
Catch a fire so you can get burned
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
The first mother to give birth... Raising her child toward heaven.
Already on her previous visit, fleeting had found the art disappointing.
Lead's busting out of a old black Impala
When we kiss, kiss the night away
Displacing logic in the memory banks of my mind
I remember all the heavy touch with you
It ain't no secret I've been around a time or two
Some rappers just say it cause it rhymes
it's our fate, now it's late, you look great
Depends on what's wrong and what is right
All my second chances, they were not deserved
Have the right to stay
But you gotta play it like you just don't care
Yeah, you gave me strength when I was weak,
Now you got to face the facts, face the music
In the grey December morning
Wuss wit the love, wuss wit the love?
'Cause dying is living without you, here
We gotta suck it in
So my standard break from life is in order
There s a bar at the end
But I'll keep loving you although you can't be true
And the world is bringing us down leaving marks on our skin
If you ain't a thug night, you ain't really doin' nothin'
Love, love, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you,
And baby I knew it
Let's move here we go
Or else I'd be asked up
And gets host from my block to your neighborhood
I think it's the point to get there.
And I thought it was me and you who gave it all
Trying to hate from my mind, I am
You are the fire go on explode
They're leading me to places decorated in flames
Spend that shit, spend that shit
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Do you seem him when he's coming and going?
Was it the docs he'd been talking about when he talked about Centurions?
Why do you want to shoot a sabre?
To get my sweet revenge
Where they were whiskey drunk
It was cold when I came over
Excuse me, it was a lousy connection!
Don't make me live in asylum
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed
Tuna hey, you know LA is up in this
Go ahead, envy me, I'm rap's map
Why wont you fall in love with me? X
I know she couldn't be psychologically scarred
You have a lot of work to do, you have a lot of work to.
When we get there we'll never leave
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Love me like you do, lo- lo- love me like you do
I've got a body of my own
Now I need you all the time
Better stay on a night brain give a fuck about a die- hard!
The boy's had a rough time, you know.
They took them egyptian kids out boundary Ray.
And when we've breathed our last
We thought we were going to be.
So let's get dressed and dance away the night
Y'all nights can't fuck with me Outlaw
Then the night time came and I snuck out my basement door again
In winter at that time it is altogether dark.
Where did the sunshine go why is it raining so
A vision of how we could have been now
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
And brought by there right to your door
Gather once again, disasters in the end,
You don't mean you're going to be as fast as I am.
Drive to dream to live we could see the world tonight
It's a fact of life, don't you forget 'em
As I approach the precipice
And all my grave will warmer sweeter be
Then I am not ashamed to be owned by the impulses of science
He's gonna do in 5 lifetimes
Then maybe we should all be praying for time
Is for the better now
I'll see what you're really like.
But my feet don't respond to my feet.
But where ever you are, I'm still holding you right here, here in my heart
You laugh your laugh and hold my body fast
Someone on your feet, someone on your feet.
She smiled and said if you are who I think you are I'd really like to meet you
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
It ain't a secret, bet that I slide 'em with something I could freak with
Well, how about an arden sword replica?
I know you don't want me anymore by the look on your face
Before I need her tenderness
Which defies all earthly descriptions
It's 3 00 A. M. In Alaska right now.
I'm fucking up people's heads without speaking, without speaking
No doubt it's not a question of whether it's true.
I will lay me down
Rap phat I'm that dude
Hes got one more mile to remember
Settled for silver how could I know
You only use it once and it's gone.
Where will this lead to
Because we rising up despite of the economy
It's that new 'Pac y'all
Such a waste what a shame my whole life is a fake
It's a star, it's a star.
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!
Two for the motherfuckin' haters keep my name in the game
Oh Ronald wesley, you're the worst
If living without a feeling is really living
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river
'Till the day he was taken away
Here comes my baby, back again
It completes entrance for L. A., with runners in 2ª and 3ª.
And after it rains, the sun comes out.
I don't know the reason
Now it's time to shoot, knife, strangle, beat and crucify
Homeboy I'll always be the one that ill!
Soon as I get right I'mma take care of you
Well I moved here from the country, thought I'd try and get ahead
No one knows what's going through her mind
Just as I start closing in
'cause enough of your love
I'm aware of what I know, I know what I know.
What do you think I'm gonna do?
When you shine at me
So froze and i so cold, slow it down i so throw
Where's the nurse with the needle?
I thinks its best you act right
We could clear this town
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cow shit,
I'm done fucking around with the guilt engine
That was you across the yard
It don't matter to me
Every city every club man, we outlaws
Who's gonna shake the whole world with a holy thunder.
You're trying to make me doubt your mind.
Maybe your voice maybe your mind
Up on banker's hill, the party's going strong
F, fuck 'em for change night
C'mon skeleton, don't you wanna see me work it now?
No sir, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
But Queen Frost only whispers
Are my tears entrancing you well I don't remember inviting you
You say ah one for the trouble two for the time
Above the mountains, far from the sea.
You better check your priorities If I'm gonna be your girl
Where that sliding scale still operates
Oh, I'm the befo', but a Brat is the after
A love so deep, a love so strong
There's a time and place for change
But I bust him in his grill
All the police ever say is stay behind the yellow tape
'Cause who you are, what you say
Its funny how the years go by
Love further down, adore that denial
Why I ain't your buddy
Sensation in my body feel life never tires
Love me for bein' me 'cause I can't change it
I'm not gonna hold you.
And he said he wouldn't change for no one
We'll all fall if we don't fall.
I hope I never see You in another life
This siphon drinks the water
You've really got a hold on me
I'm really lying, I'm like that.
So I stuck to the running
So at the age of 15, I entered the dope game
I see a new day dawning
Said I'm gonna get through this
Friends say they'll stay with you
She shotgun, and my milk Ghost so damn ripe, I'mma spoil with her
She'll be a helluva time but nickel
Babe a sky scrappers not too tall
We don't care, we don't fight
Couple homies screaming East Side!!!

Corleone is known to be stoned
This goes out to all y'all jealous nigger and bitches
What can I do with love?
I dreamed we once held hands but I awake
I'm still waiting for your last kiss
I love my baby yup yup
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
So let's all be someone else
You can hate me or love me
Put a little love in your heart
Mike and wanna talk about the beginning
I hope we don't collide
Life's got a funny way of showing
Time we needed to see these ideals for
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
But it's the thing about hurricanes.
Rock me goddess in the gentle arms of eden
I'm not her, I'm not her, I.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
A sight no eyes are meant to know
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
Who's gonna try to wash the love we left behind?
How to love, how to love.
Something about the way you look tonight
With the things you're doing
Oh no you don't wanna know what goes on when I'm on my own
To a day of wrong moves
That you climbed over on your way down
The grannies wait in the wings.
They Sent A check, We Sent Em Work
Black Chucks, black sullies, leather belle- belle
Waivers can be granted for short term lease contracts or under exceptional circumstances.
Don't you know you're my everything?
After the party it's at my spot
Well I think you know what I'm trying to say
This is the last time I'll ever see you.
Where you don't need no dough
But she lives on her own
No need for desperate alibis
I don't know who I am
I'm singing you in every breath I'm left to heave
I'm sure I'm happy to live my life.
So what we're gonna do.
If you're happy with your girl, tell her.
Man that ain't no lie
Hey, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray
You talk about the city, so you're drowning in toast.
Flat on your back under a mean old man
You've stopped walking down the hallway today, and you smiled.
But I don't know about that
The core of our spirit is naked
For all I know they might decide to raid shiiiit
Before they lock me up for all the bad things that I do
She's more beautiful than all the girls I've met.
Skip the youth, it's aging me too much
It seems more and more, what we're looking for
Well, baby, baby, baby look at you
I hear a voice saying not again
I wish you weren't in it
I will be soakin' up the sun
Tears are in your eyes
Coming thru wit my crew like this
Nights are nerve, I'm your novocaine.
Rest your head here, feed our nation for us, please
She put her arms around her and said, it's okay to cry
Getting beat up ain't no fun
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere down the road
Which he does. So for the first time during the mission,
Female I like, what I want to give all night
The report shall indicate, where appropriate, possible amendments to be made to the statute and funding systems.
My love for you is all but new
Well, I thought things were gonna be different
Are- adaptation is not to be used in tests for aerobic ready biodegradability.
Late at night, no one would have heard a thing.
Maybe then you will live again, live again
All I got is you baby on my brain
And then you hate it
I can take your cares away if you just let me ease the pain
Only only only only higher than the king can
When the pain is gone
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with
Hey I'm on my way
It's time to take it back now
For example, to demonstrate his ability by running through all the Charlie Parker licks
I do it for you
Another old prophet's on the fence.
You tried to duck your head
Seen through the windows of Hell
Now I'm losing who I am
I had a dream... That we could do whatever, whatever we wanted to do
Now you want a star, but I just think you should know
Let the music heal your soul
We can do the damn than, than, than
Is hope that you will hear me sing
If you think I'm believing that one, you're obviously dumb
She just feels like dying
Please tell me who you are
The enemy shrivel and die
Since nigga's did the snake runnin' man in the walk
All things considered I'm doin' better than I deserve.
It freezes before it hits the ground
And they let you up, finally, dancing it up
There's just excuses when the truth is nowhere near
A big fat flagrant hooray hooker
Checking to see if they could find that transistor radio
Goin' down the steps on a white line
From depths of Hell Thy people save
Throw on something mad provocative play with the top lock
Blame it on the boom boom
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
But you said goodbye to me
I knew right there you were the breath of life.
Strike you from the light
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
You're still giving me hope.
We're reading when we're waiting for the bus.
The we grew up to be bored
And it's just my luck. I like you but I
Only surfaced for a companion,
Try to remember who you are, you'll never realize
All I need to breathe
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring,
If you could be anyone would you ever let me down
With a night like pay, and a night like me gotta stay high
Go, greased lightnin', you're coastin' through the heat lap trial
Wanna push you baby, but never to far
If we never get the chance
I'm floating in a black balloon
If I don't change the pace
Let's hear the one about the Devil's Queen
So I'm moving removing wackiness from my stratosphere
Headed out for southern California
Snitches, let 'em point the find
As it warms your face
All a night want is some of that lip service
And take your chance right now
There's no clothes to wear
Let me love you to death
At Any night out to stop ours
I need your love every day
Yo, yo. What's this police stuff?-
I think about my happiest times
Mashing through the city yo, and the foot it don't lie
Love for revolution love love love.
How do you eat with me if you don't starve?
She a calling out to meet mi wife and mate uh chat
I don't have time for that
Would you believe that yesterday
In the night it's haunting me
What? You gotta make your money work for you
I know it just can't be, darling, no no.
Now I see you've broken a feather
you're going to school for a private detective
I can't relate, I can't relate, no
My sense of humor might have narrowed with my age
And they got doggies screamin' on a chain
You'll get the idea of luck.
When I'm dead, I'll be happy.
That's brought up in a home of sin
Watashitachi ni as no jiyuu to
I stay late tonight right
All I need is just a mic and a track
But will you love me tomorrow
Your dog or your brother,
We're not going to burn, we're not gonna stop.
I don't think they'll ever listen so now's the time to act.
Most of us only care about money making
Life as a precious gift given from God
I didn't have it, wasn't able
One who gave you to me
I'm all your fault.
Tears from my eyes when I remember
Maybe this year will be better than the last
A big black wide gorilla
In an atom bomb such damping actually occurs.
I'll soothe your troubled mind
I put thirty in your head, all in the same hole
Between your heart and mine
Where are you gonna go...
If you weren't so far away
Whenever the rain falls down
Yea You got to love me
Who writes the rules, who's got the master plan
And I know what I must do
Donna, hold all my calls, will ya, doll?
Gonna do Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice
No- oh, no- oh. I don't wanna take this place, no
Under her sweater and before she
Keep on with it, keep on with it, keep on.
What a man, what a man, what a man,
From the words that you need to say
We pluck polar bear winter on my side
It has a great big slide for you to ride and swings that hang from stars
Where I need find a reason to be strong
I mean, I'm take off... 1, 2, 3...
You used me and you lied
But it's never that obvious for me
Returning him may buy life for my children.
But you was wrong, didn't know about the big long
Kill them and you'll see them die, yeah.
Every time I hear that song
Lay down softly in our sorrow
Down at the river, we're doing fine
Until I'm sure that you're the one
Alternatives can only be compared in the first place if a comparable assessment of the effects is carried out.
Before I had the deal I was out here with the say
I like it like that, I like it like that, I like it like that
To start him a band of his own
Yeah, when old Nick comes wailing' in,
Never showed concern, when the tables were turned.
Y'all are really not stopping us dude
I've been cryin' lonely nights
I know what I'm doing
You the troop get money it's yours
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
What if you've never had anything?
Heads quick, your little chick, that deliver get a little glimpse at a
And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright
Oh my, it's time we found a way to
You are my gleaming Goddess
It ain't safe., in the current state, of our democracy
Take it off, stretch it out, gon' head let it out
You got to listen to your heart
Living in shame and lies.
Integrating life lines carry on with your shine, shine
You are not a these vegetarian, is it?
We try to bumble like ass
I'm not selling drugs to the devil in the past.
But you know what's happenin', night
It's too hard to mention
You love me and its inviting, to go where life is more exciting
If the shred is picked up by the pick?
Yeah I just wanna hear it over and over
Stop worrying about them other hoes
Will this bother you as a scientist, I inquired, to go through a ritual like this?
When i on top, look at me now
You don't want to take me to Virgil with a wounded leg, do you?
I waited by the phone and prayed to be picked up.
I used to have a dog and Bingo was his name oh, so uh
I put my ass on the line when you walk by...
I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
I just breathe in, I just breathe out
When you're not home, you're not home!
Hey Millie boy man you go ahead
Only a fool gives this away
Do we really have to explain?
Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you.
But times have changed and so have we
Then I've got the time
'Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
While cruising on the black of night,
I can help you anytime
At least I thought I knew you then
I've had enough, I'm just a man.
Confused you isolate all your intensions,
This is a man's world!
Lay ya head on me
I'm not sure of what I'm running from
If you were as real as me
Plus playing for keeps in these New York streets
Can I lay in your bed all day
Howling like a mongrel praying for a friend
A golden handshake for every daughter
Show what I mean to you
To be snuffed like a flame by the hidden hand of fate
I think I like today
Until the doctor arrives, there's nothing you can do.
From birth, we have different hands from what you have.
Hear the rain drops tapping on the roof
Life looks better when you drink away the pain
Supporting Parliaments Worldwide e strategies and methodologies for action to support
He at a nice hotel right by a festival
She's got me pinned, my back to the wall I'm thinking this is it
Not had an accident, lurid? Said Johnson.
Your heart belongs to me.
Change whatever gets strange in your aprons and your curls
Mujik to there there pe yet gum pain sancta
And tell me you think I'm a fool
Pedal to the flo' with a 808 clap
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
I said we take a little trip through time,
The lines of life are never long when seen from end to end
And every thing all real fuck what you might can get
I find fingers in my coat pocket
Concierge doctor to the rich, And an on- call doctor to the rest of us.
They'll never make the green kilometer, will they?
Would you pray for me?
Modern love does not exist
We are the feeling you get in the golden state
On the Cumberland riverboat, E. W. Stephens
We'll go to the dm and get the ID.
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' mad or too soft
Words only you would hear
We'll be here a while
But little girls and daddy cry with teardrops angels cry with roses and with rain
You'll finally understand what you've done.
An answering cry, equally sharp and chilling, arose from the dunes nearer the house.
You say you're sorry, say you're to blame,
You're a brother of mine
All Your love is, oh
You won't ever see through me
Oh baby, my love don't seem the same
Broken glass of a language
Nothin' but the net from the 3
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You don't even break for a second, do you?
Comb your mind for the treasures of the soul
Love is such a wonderful thing
Are is chillin', Ruff is chillin'
