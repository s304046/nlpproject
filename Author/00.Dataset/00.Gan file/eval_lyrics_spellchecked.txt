You're going to burn in hell.
Once again a testament of pain
They had approached the castle on foot, after an earlymorning climb up a long, winding road from the city.
You got your balls to the wall, man
B- A- S- T- A- R- D, stick that needle deep in me
But they've taken my father away from me.
You know I can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals
So I had to shoot him in the back of the head from 50 feet away
All alone on this road
That's how master degrades you
The Four Kings from the kantian Gate and errand God ixia.
And baby I'll do you up, do you up baby
By young men who try to reduce her down
Some of them headed home, some of them looking for trouble.
One love, one love, one love, one love
With your voice in my head
So beautiful and drop dead hot
Whouldn't he know something by her clothes?
All we need is the good affection
Give it time, things will get better
Without destroying my love.
They say I'm 730, say I spa out
Don't fuck around with my baby, man I swear she love me
Wont stop now and still I try
Hasn't there been enough cryin'
Oh, its so better now
I'm going to the roll night.
Or a second of thought
To bear it to dark Calvary
New sneakers, pockets way deeper than yours
Airy, who can test I, the true King of N. Y.
And make damn sure you never forget it, committed, i ready, i with it
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If it's not too late for coffee
I wish you nothin' but the best in sickness and health
We let it slip away
A little boogie boogie In the back of my mind
In the morning I got in a fight with myself, I got the bruises to prove it
With speed like this, it will take us over 20 days.
Then the answer is getting revealed by inches, you are finding yourself.
We met up at the Abyss ready to slaughter the bitches
Well, you're the one who lost interest first.
You ride in a what what's up, don't get it fucked up
On stage with a b- boy stance.
M. R., my number one fan what?!
And the double game change, I keep em on display
Warm me in your latin fire
Because the music they constantly play
Chapter NINETEEN casket was waiting in the boat bay gallery when Branscombe's pinnace docked.
One song at a time.
So you wanna be a rap rock superstar, and live large
And can you feel the love tonight
So we can get with the models
When we're around?
You're in the queue for the boys.
Until death do us apart,
Too much food for thought, too much food.
Taste it on the tip of my tongue
You will save the day
Seems he's lost some stocks and shares
Especially now there's prostitutes on alford lane
You are so perfect, I just wanna look into your eyes.
And we're gonna get some
How I lived my life for you
From the BART train to a tour bus
I wanna get so high
And when you try you try too hard it comes off fake
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
Take a good look around
Pass me the bottle, pass me the wine,
So baby, please don't go away. I'll do whatever just to make you stay. And in the meantime I'll just wait.
Within yourself and within your mind
If I could be there
An' your blood runs cold
I just can't help myself ah ah ahhhh
Our real test of strength is caring
I put my root down
There is nothing I can't do when I have on my undergo
There is just one moon and one golden sun
In beef we briefly bankrupt but you suck litigation
We're going to the party, we're going to the groove.
Come the day, you return my love on hold
So love where you're at, yeah love where you're at
I can no longer bear this cage
When the rustle meets the rush
I'm sorry, but I'll understand.
When you go back in time
I don't care about time
This is torture to me
It just isn't right, oh, why should I be cold?
'Cause honey I believe what you said
No! Get out my face please, can't you see I'm on the net
And you will win my love
And I know how bad it feels inside
You told me you wouldn't ever let it out
I just wanna play a board game
And, uh... I might have some ice, actually.
And lift our voices higher
Not only was she carrying a heavy briefcase, but she was exhausted.
I'll never forget it-
Got the Jumpin' Jack Flash
I don't need to be the hero tonight
What a Huron loves good for good bad for bad!
I'll always be with you.
Because you were out of sight.
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
River stones and broken bones
We've knocked our bones together for so long
Well death is where I could of gone
We'll just let love lead the way
I'll do it you'll see.
I keep buying them, and my husband keeps burning them!
I ought to leave him, but he needs me.
Ever since the first computers...... There have always been ghosts in the machine.
Seeing them in my dark cupboard with my great big cake.
You've never been so real
Take it off and you'll be naked.
I'm the one, the one that'll make it clear
We put the clocks back
Where has the time all gone to?
Put a little love in your heart
Now I only wake up with a smile to see how far I've come
You got to plow, plow to the end of the row
Ready to set it off, I keep 'em blind and lost
'Cause in my hood err night gotta eat
And tried to make me forget where I came from
I take and even laugh
He's waiting for the panic to set in
Most of the workers have no notions
Bent in the Caddy Coupe me and Daddy Duke
Blowing up my phone like a welfare hotline
A soldier lies wounded still
Oh, give me more like before
Not a game or a race but the stake is high
Is a place I wanna go
I know I'm lost, I know I'm blind
I think you need a chair
I know the king will come again
Society's townhouse and everyone's a freak
Better find, better find out
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Yes- Gonna wait till you get married?
Listen! You make this bad blood rise
You and me, we live a life
Oh let's get a little wild
My lungs take in the fragrance of remorse, what is the cost, am I living,
A parent who sows a seed
So I let go, I leave it all behind
I don't think these nights can bear it
Same old thing happen every day
She f ok so good see I taught her boy
I'd like it all, I'd like it all, girl.
Turn it up baby make your move
They know that Santa's on his way,
And if you fell in love will you hold on to it
You'll be known soon.
I have spent so much time
We used to hold hands and had such a deep convoy
Getting things done around here
But you're really interested in dying?
Sweep him off his feet, pull the trigger, let me sick him
You got to believe me
Oh, John, you have to turn it off.
All the colors have faded
Take me, take me, take me,
My room is still messed up and I know why
You have to give me a little room.
Can you dig it yes, I can
And you can lick but don't bite
Lost and frantic, new age romantic
And he doesn't have to know
And kiss goodbye to the earth
Call her a bully, she'll blow up your whole damn playground
I see your picture in the news most every day
Far from these savage lands
Baley's eyes never left the robot.
I have been lost... Since my husband passed.
I- i- i- i- i- i- i- i- i- rip your dick off
We've done our share of slamming doors and wondering what we're together for
And walking in the dust again
That's called my bullets and lugers, I put 'em deep in your neck.
Well I know I shouldn't smoke
He's selling a disc in a shop.
It may include, at the choice of the manufacturer, an audible component.
Mix up passion with fruit, sangria
I pray You, send Your power, Holy Spirit fall upon me
And you can peel those eyes
Baby get on this side
Afraid I realize the train won't stop
Oh, just let me go
Elisha, there is a 13th colony of humankind, is there not?
I hate to say it
I'm stealing your thunder.
You did, baby- you did
My position will be compromised if I'm found here.
So don't be actin' surprised when your daughter
There was nothing I could say
And I cannot pray anymore
New plates on it, hold them keys up
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
'cause I done changed, I done changed that lock on my door
Massive hard on in here!
Uh, that stuff you cook
They can't see everything on earth
I told him I didn't think I had
How we wonder, how we wonder, watching down below
I made it easy to dance to this
She's cold to the touch
Show me love, show me love
He said If these were my last words,
Wiggle like a snake's wiggle like a duck.
Would you be wise enough 2 let me go
To do it by yourself
She had actually been amused at first by Devin's reaction and Rovigo's in the marketplace.
It was April the tenth
The cracks in the walls that shift and sweat
No on needs to be alone, oh save me
Cause sweetie you're my kinda guy
But me, I expected it to happen
Keeps you standing on your feet
Baby I'm on my way to you!
I'm living to be able to live.
Sink or swim, I see how we go now.
We've got families and mouths to feed,
I'm not sure I'd see it so well.
Sex- money- murder we call this the hit em' up flow
Nights know I exist only to wreck
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
They jumped in the hotheads, everything was fine.
I was, I've been, and I'm gone
It's not a haven here.
Must not be mistaken for just another dream
You're saying you're not interested in it.
Why do we bother to stay?
The Lord, strong and mighty
And he'll kiss your lips
He was leaning and nodding
Do you feel my heart beating
Come on and give it up
In time, but time takes time you know
And who are you to judge her pain? 'cause now maybe your suffer the same.
But everything's fading babe, cause you're all I see
Keep it right here on New Mexico's finest rock.
It's like a parody about racism.- Miss Reed Racism.
It's not your fault, it's not your fault.
I will search the land and sea
Can you see all the pain behind my smile
Leave it up, leave it up, leave it up!
Bitch, I'ma be stunting until the day I go what
Have thought of taking a short trip to the cottage.
Leaving are has you fearing for your life, maybe.
Hit me when you get home baby
Bite his leg!... Then I got away
Baby, are you feeling me?
And pick out the perfect memory of you
They shall rot, they shall rot
Caressin' on the world main
Your style stinks kid, ya garbage
'Cause I can't picture me being without you
I spend that money on the regular
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
The little Moor, our el- Musafir, was standing by the door.
They're gonna put us back in the house, bitch.
All by yourself there in your world of blue
Do not sing this song
I kissed ya, oh yeah
You're a rich man, Rex, you've already got what you wanted.
She locked you out of your life.
Scream and shout 'till we work it out?
But how could I etesian, I wasn't around
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well
As he gunned the motor
I'm gonna shoot ya down Jesse James
And who lags get body bagged in maserati bags zipped with toe tags
I was put here for you
I'll be falling asleep on an empty street
Now a christmas time everybody fi' sing
And make me look like I'm another fool
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Got me high and I ain't coming down yo
As part of the healthy back and forth??
Don't be in love with the autograph
Now, Mr Petersen, what political party did your father belong to?
Now unverified I was just listenin' to this song
Seeing your father dying, did it not fuel you?
And you make John feel all right
If you come to see me, hope you're coming soon
It seems that the generals have abandoned their positions.
And it's scratching out my eyes
Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
I. From your pedestal come down and
I can't take it much more than I can.
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
Then he started sayin' somethin' 'bout the way I was dressed
Another battle to be fought
And the border bums never saw
I don't need any pretense just hold me and feel me.
Behind the Phantom curtains I'm smoking something I can't say.
And may all your Christmases be white
It's triple that's overheard the Doc's instruction.
You'll have to give him a good time.
It ended when you said goodbye
As if I was crazy.
Rich man, poor man, you're either?
Sh- She's beautiful and fun...- and smart, and I love the gowns she designs.
Running about in a daze in the heart of London
Because I think we should be flying.
You gotta give it a shot
Have y'all nights ever thought about
When the face is in my face
It's just a mistake, nothing more.
I'm still glad that He did
So he made a fiddle peg of her long finger bone
And said the next time, they would sail away just where they pleased
Grinning with a lost stare
Really wanna go to the island, my feet up on a tree,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Hit me with your best shot
Look in my soul, girl, its torn all apart
