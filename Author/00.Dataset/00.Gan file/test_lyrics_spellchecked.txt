Always thought I could get hurt pretty bad
Encased inside the gauntlets hung in quotas
You come walkin' through town
Oh my love, You bring me clarity amidst the chaos
Every night, you're gonna be there, you're gonna be.
I know you're still there watching over me
There has been scattered violent incidence in the alone mixed race neighborhood.
No offense to y'all, but I feel a bit gifted
I won't be the one to hold you
I just slap them, turn around and ask them this
But if you cross me, you lost me forever, baby
This does not feel like home my friends are far away
She's gone away, maybe she'd stay
No- one beside me on train rides
I'm just tryin' to find the woman in me, yeah
And the home look like the spot on the other side of the see's
Watching my nirvana crashing to the ground
And it makes me sad, to be surrounded
I'm alone with me and my own.
I feel you on my fingertips
With the CIA's mole,
So I think I'll just do arts in college, and hopefully...
Barley said in a carefully respectful voice, It is my afternoon off, Commissioner.
Shes fighting for justice and the American way
The engineer's ring the bell.

Trying to tie his high top shoes
He's the anyone who can help me
Should you want to cross the line

I'm a criminal with no crime
There's so much today, who's got time to listen?
Tell me when will you be mine
The coming of the new Overlordian
Just to hear you say that you love me
Keeping me at the back of the queue
Out in the parkin' lot
Eatin' lobster tail, like they fuckin' chicken nuggets, yeah
I hope you find it with me or without me.
It's not what the boss is doing.
Hey, guys, um, there's pizza in there if you want some.
Don't want to be a statistic.
Machine gun mind and a junkie's rush
Why don't you find time, and realize
Way more than I've ever seen
Oh my mind please give me a dream
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
Well there's nothing I wouldn't give
All our sorrows will end and our voices will blend
He's a big- city, hard- working man just trying to climb the ladder
But I'm sure where I'm going.
These days go on and on...
You're going to the bridge now?
You're the best of specimens, and I'm breathless.
Well I guess I don't mind
I have so much to think about, so little time.
He knows there's something missing and he knows it's you and I
All you give is pain a curse upon your name
Well, it's my practice to build up a picture of a character of a man before I speak with him.
Stand right there, stand right here, see if something happens.
I'm sittin' here, la, la
Who wrote it in the diary.
Shot down on the pavement
Could be something physical...... Or it might be an emotional disturbance.
Give up and let's begin again.
Publisher cannot add style s because the style already exists.
Can I find, can I find, can I find You,
Take a cab to the next town.
'Cause I've got nothing real, just empty space to fill
Like the dumb brutes, who in a secret lair
And the night goes by so very slow
Should I paint the Grey sky blue, the Grey sky blue?
With a song of praise to sing
And I'm sure I'm fluffing him.
Well, music's calling, I'm just answering the bell.
Feeling like a freight train, trying to break chains
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here!
And I'll be in your world forever.
The beat that spins you around
Snitches ain't real 'cause dey lie so come did a better lie
But makin' sure that they spending ya
I've bought her clothes and I've bought her hair.
But the dollar is still the same, the dollar is still the same.
Somebody wants something of nothing you had
But you haven't got the nerve
He'il never wear a police badge again in his life.
To the place, that we shared
The men who died? I'm going to see to it personally that their families are well taken care of.
Chara's pistol boomed, the shot ripping through Tostig's throat.
All the engines too loud, all the pavements hiss
But who keeps score when you're in mid- air?
I will wait for you
And it's the love from my fans got me still here
A hot tub full of poop and a twisted doppelg√§nger.
You wanna make a memory
That's the only transportation he had. So he was very careful.
Long time, baby, long time ago, baby
Hey you, big mood, guide me to shelter
Talking bout a hunted bottles, night you ain't popped shit
When they all should let us be, we belong to you and me
Won't break your heart and tell you lies
Go to the bar and drink some brew
Maybe it's the devil or the Lord.
Keep an eye out for Sal, don't you get in?
What a dying world re- defines, the reasons we strive to exist
She can not say the words they need,
That he cut out my heart like a paper doll
Nothing they can sing about
Bed- written and destined to never leave the
Haste, haste to be loved.
But I'll take her back again
Deny, I'm sorry, but I have to say, I'm.
Cruisin' is made for love, cruisin' is made for us
This HOUSE IS A TRAP
They were married in September back in 1969
Or a uzi, be careful who you choose, could choose a marvin, choose a ship
And you can bask in the mist, emotion bliss, desire's going round and round
Any road I take is leading me here
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
In the stage of the lone headlight
But the funny thing is anytime I've gotten what I want
We have the future in our hands.
It might not even close with a prayer.
Can we grow out? Whoa
Determination is a vital part of me
Or make a sandwich of us both but the bread is too stale
A wanted man in New Orleans
And mine is still waiting
Turn on the red light.
See the dance that needs no alibi
This time my happiness won't disappear
I can see what's coming, it's a bloody mess
Hater, what you looking at?
You know there can't be love without atropin
I wanna break bread wit' the cats that I starve with
I'm not able to help feeling invisible.
And she's the wildest heart I know
Too young for me she want Sosa, shoots in the Range Rover
Put it over so politely, you tried to flip the scripts
If you do then forgive me
For every heart you break
From obstructing my discussion 'cause I rhyme too hard
Tell me how it feels now
Built by hand on land people slaved for
And when I'm finished, your whole world's in flames,
So give in to the heat of the moment
And flip the whole set 'cause cash wreck for all my souljahs
There are those who find these times a crime and those whose souls will never mind
More bodies being buried, I'm losing my homies in a hurry
I'm still staring at the sky
We're sleeping in our bed until morning.
It's more than you deserve.
You're the one who's the one who's the one who's.
Look good on my posters, the yacht is the dopes
Through the hues we? All find a way to follow
Ya laugh 'till ya don't think it's funny
They say we're going in with the day light
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
There's something like a void I feel
A E following in eastern, northeastern direction until A E.
Dancing on a Saturday night
Now before you get into the vault, there is a counting room.
When I need someone to love
Press his peoples, left a message, nothin' peaceful
The girls are going to be soon gooey!
Show me my favorite beauty spot
The sound of music-
More than a children game to play
And I could always depend on you
Just let it go, it's okay.
I pass the mic to Mr. Shift.
A dry land wakes up to a dry land.
Stay and take my fate
Tommy corolla wishes he could have traded his life.
To do all the things,
I tried to figure it out, got a black out
Doctor held me in his hands when I was born.
Yo hobby we got more rep than Lucky Luciano
There can be no sorrow,
But I could be your type
Who tells you what to do?
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
The Sucker my is on our way, then they bite us.
She love my white T, my cars and that I'm icy
Since you opened up, I know you're hopin' it's wack
Running victim that falls in the scary cinema
Baby you want me, you need me
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
It's kinda hard through carelessness I scared they moms
She, la, la, la, la, baby
So what the hell did we sign
So joe sinister came through the armed recruit to blank crews
All I need is everything I want
You know you have to die when I see you.
You're gonna have a problem with that shit.
I don't know if I'll die laughin'
Got the notes that you sent me
But maybe everything that dies some day comes back.
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
Then it felt like going through the motions
A thousand people gather in the streets of Manhattan
He's just looking at a murder murder
Still regret nothing 'cause we
3x A million miles away
Dem get all rowdy when mi give it to dem
Baby rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Any other day I'd call you.
Counter fits don't stop the wettest of us we Brooklyn
To pick her up at full speed
And H. E. L. P. Has got the best food in town
She said maybe you're ashamed that things turned out this way
And, oh, when I'm in your warm embrace
I'm back to the roots I've been.
She's not driving the train to the kicks.
All you need are your kicks when you need 'em
Living on let it go, open eyes surprise yo let's role
She would go in and out of our checkpoint every day.
Maybe because at least we know we made it
In the back of the buzz,
As we rub against each other sweating under the covers
You fixed my tits, you gave me a nose job months ago.
I wonder what it's like
This is the last time
I watched you deal in a dying day
You're someone else's love, now you're not mine
Lock you in the fucking trunk
How long have you been feeling sad and blue?
Everything is beyond my reach
Nigger, where's the dollhouse?
One that's void of all discretion, such an awful tearing sound
And now I'm touching myself
Until it's gone, nothing's real.
You are my love... Fade
Back it up then smack it
It's a love song.
Oh, then I never would have heard your hilarious efficient- officiant quip.
Watch out for me, I'm as awesome as I wanna be
They always smile and are polite
I'm still Mr. Money ain't thing
Come Sunday evening, it'll be on the stands.
When you say assignments, Bourne had asked, what do you mean?
A beatles heart lying still, murdered by illusions of the mind.
I have to make a move to somewhere miles away
we're dancing to the dark side of this tune
Real crook, you would think I'm some type of Bush
My legato is staccato but what I don't fret
Wall- Eye, Wall- Eye, this is Boomer One- Seven in the Zee!
The private office line, the apartment, the mobile.
Give us a bottle of penny.
And once that happened, once I was locked to it, drinking... All else vanished.
You know there's only one shot
Free to pound the lost streets
And the flames keep getting higher
I'll find my way home
Working up along the western ridge
We're a couple of shootin' stars
It's visitin' day at San Quinton
And I refused to just wither in place
All hit the deck with your hands behind the neck!
Remember boys, always open her beer first
Our hearts are Yours forever
we're all just figures messed up in coincidence
I can find somebody who's gonna love me
Because a nigger young as me.
Now we can do whatever we wanna do
doesn't hang in the night
They gave her one more day
? Up the glass is shattering, bitch it ain't mattering
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful... Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful... Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
I demand to see a neutral representative as required by the Federation- circassian peace treaty.
The building turned it's back ignored my call,
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Nigger that don't ride right
It's a Friday time to hit the hot spot
We knew how to take a heed.
I know that this is was I need to do
Dreaming of a blue horizon
Be Frank and say I Did It My Way
We never do look sour
Somebody save me, I think I just killed somebody baby
I want you to love me
The cold's coloring your cheeks.
Collect the dough at a show as you sip the Mo'
Geisha girl suffer many times a fool
I've been begging everyone in my life, she said.
Yeah, okay, you like it
Look in the eye and feel the world.
And I trust it like the ground
I'm gonna pull it, pull it, pull the trigger
Think, there are streets and streets below her!
I sat there in front of the screen
Just stands alone, her face set in stone
Nothing left to lose or gain,
Baby you're the one for me
Can't stop, no I won't stop
It's good to be here again
With a truth in your heart, we'll make a fresh start
Closer, closer, closer to me.
Shoot off both your knees
Beneath the silver moon with my banjo right in tune
Were the folks that you met there
And I can't fool around anymore
Ma'am, you are fine. They're gonna come get you.
Her clothes I did shuck, just like Dan I strictly stuck
'Cause I'm so over it, finally having fun
A fool pretendin' that love's never ending
Nor could their discretion be relied on.
Red eyes itchy both day and night
You've been married, you've had a child.
We'll go a little harder.
Very messy, yeah they're getting me down
Ay It's not worth the drama
With no tricks the fix comes with dope fiend precision
Having a fling with a pretty young thing 'till early morning
Must have been an awful sight. It was.
Just like we used to love
Yeah, leave me back home to my trance
I swear, this love will find a real love
