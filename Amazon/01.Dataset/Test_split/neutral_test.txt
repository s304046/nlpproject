Bottom of some of the cans were dented/extended.
If selling the product to the us market, provide some instructions in English.

No place on Classico bottles does it show any expiration date?

The cap was loose. it was leaking
This Cola is not bad tasting, but it probably is not good tasting

Sometimes there are production issues and I have to toss some. Not a fan of this instance here.
Easy to make. The filling is pretty good but the crust is unpleasant.
Much smaller than pictured.  Not what was expected
I thought this  product would be more like SuziQ but not, I was not happy with the quality.
Decent quality way over priced. This is only a 1 ounce bag
A large can for the money but 60 % juice and 40 % chopped calms. Not worth the price.
I was hoping it would be a brighter gold

The product is not the same as Trader's Joe's.  The shape of the candy is not always the same.

It was not round and thin and even like it was when I was young.
Weird flavor - not bad to but acidic for me.
Not for me. Like eating nothing.

These are delicious but unfortunately the chips were all broken on arrival. So a bag of crumbs.

The cost is too high and for the flavor, it is just not worth it.
Tasted old, just eat the nuts out of she will
Seemed a bit stale and not much licorice flavor. Fresher would have been better.
They work , but after while they lose there sealability

I want 1% low fat milk, but they give me 2% reduced fat milk.
Only get 2 per serving, about 1/2 the size of a Oreo, makes them quite pricey.
The bitter under-taste is just too much to take.
this is a food item and should be packaged inside a box to prevent spoilage and bruising on the box
this item came in a sealed plastic bag instead of a box which was shown
Basic flavor. I was not impressed but it was not a bad taste .
I like stevia and monk fruit for sweetening. Please pay attention, the 8 oz bottle is stevia only.

A lot lighter than I expected.
Like plums. However, was not as fresh as I expected.
Was not the ones that I remember from my youth.
