The entire bag was like someone stepped on it and the let it melt in the sun.
A little too sweet for me.
Nothing to write home about.
Really flat tasting.
Overall nice flavour but I only gave rating of 3 because the Amaretto flavour is on the weak side.
Did not contain the ultra black, came with a regular monster...
Had a weird consistency but we still ate it, it was ok
Bottom of some of the cans were dented/extended.
If selling the product to the US market, provide some instructions in English.
Chocolate is somewhat old, not what you would expect from Lindt
The different popcorns was fun to try.  But the flavoring was not worth it
crackers are sealed but boxes damaged, slit down side of two so far.
Does not look like this in person. At all. Faded. Pinkish
The box and the items inside came smashed.
Wish the story books still came in assorted flavors.
Not a big fan of the taste, and the citric acid burns the mouth.

I did not know it needed milk to make it instead of water
Cats will not eat it
No place on Classico bottles does it show any expiration date?
It only came with one 5oz bag. However price seemed to match one bag!
Out of container the flavor is minimal. Do some minor crushing will release the flavor
One of the jars was open when I received the package and had leaked.
I expected it to be hotter than horseradish off the grocery store shelf. It was not.
It did not come with the rub only the sauces.
Expensive, but good.

Does not have a strong flavor, you need to brew a small cup to get any flavor from it.
Not enough product too much water
It is a medium dark coffee but I just do not care for it. I will go back to SB Sumatra.
I  need to eat them up within a week or they got spoiled from inside.

See above note.  Used on barbecued pork chops.
mints were soft but no color or mint flavor at all
Fast shipping but received box opened missing 2 packages of Starbursts.
The formulation tastes different than SBL below...  I defer to others for what the difference is...
Maybe does not fill you up.  Kind Of expensive for what you get.
The cap was loose. it was leaking
This Cola is not horrible tasting, but it definitely is not good tasting
I had not realized it was caffeinated coffee until it arrived.  My daughter-in-law loves it.
Spilled some on a rug and there is nothing getting that red stain out. Be careful!
When I recieved them they were stuck together
It came well packaged. It was just a little smaller than I expected.
I have not eaten any of the food. I bought this as an emergency food source to have on hand!!

Different smell when I used it with my beef stew
Over paid but it was what it said it was
Tastes like cough medicine.
Gum was stale if that is even possible. I love that apple flavor but it was like chewing a tire.
because its like processed cardboard. No flavor yuck
This coffee is too weak. I end up using more than I should.
This gum is tasty, however, the flavor only lasts a few minutes after you pop it into your mouth.
These have no tropical flavors in them. They are just bags of the wild berry.
Does not taste the same as at the restaurant
there were several empty sleves in the box.
Sometimes there are production issues and I have to toss some. Not a fan of this instance here.
Easy to make. The filling is pretty good but the crust is awful!
Much smaller than pictured.  Not what was expected
I thought this  product would be more like SuziQ but not, I was not happy with the quality.
Decent quality WAY OVER PRICED. This is only a 1 ounce bag
A large can for the money but 60 % juice and 40 % chopped calms. Not worth the price.
I was hoping it would be a brighter gold
Shorter than expected
Good flavor but next time ill buy the regular size jerky. The tips are tough to chew.
I could not tell any difference between it and say Folgers.
Unbelievably hot we enjoy spicy food but this is ridiculous .use extremely sparingly

Was supposed to have 20 but only received 15.
Only 19 instead of 20

Taste, thickness.
leaves a strange after taste to these.
Not particularly the one I like.
The taste was sort of watery.
The product is not the same as Trader's Joe's.  The shape of the candy is not always the same.
If you like really watered down drinks this is the stuff for you.
While I like the convenience of how it is used. However I do not care for the after taste...
It was not round and thin and even like it was when I was young.
Weird flavor - not bad to but acidic for me.
Not for me. Like eating nothing.
Crackers are great except they arrived broken. Packaging is not adequate.
To soon to tell anything about this product.
These are okay but have a bit of an artificial taste and texture. I will not buy them again.
This tea not bad tasting..just drunk the gallon and it did nothing for me
the pkg i received was out of date
I was expecting a softer mint.

I guess because of humidity. They lasted not even day
What happened to the multi tasking sprinkles that baked well. These do not.
Tasty but made with junk.
My husband loves these. I do not like the flavor of stevia, so I do not like them.
These were melted when they arrived so they cannot be used in chip form.
not lightly salted, very salty.
Lack freshness and flavor
Should last a long time
Taste good. but the price is expensive.
These are delicious but unfortunately the chips were all broken on arrival. So a bag of crumbs.

Some nuts are bitter. My mom likes it ground and mixed with oatmeal.
Mine were very lightly salted and had a bitter, stale taste.
It left a film in my mouth and was underwhelming licorice.
The cost is too high and for the flavor, it is just not worth it.
Tasted old, just eat the nuts out of she will
Seemed a bit stale and not much licorice flavor. Fresher would have been better.
They work , but after while they lose there sealability
The tea is not green as expected.  Green tea with a brown color is usually not optimal.

Dry and overpriced
Way smaller than expected
4 teal, 4 green, 4 pink....... was hoping for three of each color as pink is our favorite
I want 1% low fat milk, but they give me 2% reduced fat milk.
Only get 2 per serving, about 1/2 the size of a Oreo, makes them very pricey.
The bitter under-taste is just too much to take.
this is a food item and should be packaged inside a box to prevent spoilage and bruising on the box
this item came in a sealed plastic bag instead of a box which was shown
Basic flavor. I was not impressed but it was not a bad taste at all.
I like stevia and monk fruit for sweetening. Please pay attention, the 8 oz bottle is stevia only!

Love these classic Spree, but there are no reds in the ENTIRE CASE! Bad batch? Sigh.
It was alright. I had to add a bunch of parmesan cheese to make it palatable.
The bag was torn from the bottom and the price is double then what I would have paid
Small and light.  Pricy
Still waiting for results
Taste is ok but It is weak, you need to put two extra scoops!
Vanilla flavor is not as dominant as I would like.
I am so eager to try this, but why $25 to ship to Oregon?
One of the bottles had leaked.
Eh, not that tasty.

I am sorry but it is not my favorite.
really did not care for the taste. Not really worth the cost.
A lot lighter than I expected.
Like plums! However, was not as fresh as I expected.
Was not the ones that I remember from my youth.
Not worth $12.00. It is ok but not great. Taste nutty, but no vanilla. Will not buy again.

I ofund that this cinnamon was a bit too powdery for my taste.
