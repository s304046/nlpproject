",neutral
"Like product but took almost a month.  Jammed in a tiny box.
",neutral
"I could not drink it because of the sugar content..35grams of sugar..and I am diabetic
",neutral
"I like the two way wick.
",neutral
"The box was squished, the cereal was more like quite small crumbled pieces
",neutral
"I could gave bought this at the Acme for $1.00
",neutral
"It had an ok taste but was not sour enough for me. It was not a good value for the money.
",neutral
"Not quite good, have ordered similar product at Amazon Pantry that were much better.
",neutral
"I wish I could have chosen the entree.
",neutral
"It tastes good, but not worth buying. Comes quite little. Too expensive for it.
",neutral
"That it was  edible
",neutral
"The cans were all dented and busted up
",neutral
"Does not give the burning sensation
",neutral
"My concern was that the jar was not sealed. Took a chance and ate one anyways
",neutral
"Tough. Fall apart easily. Edible.
",neutral
"There is only 8 of them and they are quite tiny. Flavor was okay, I could taste taro but it was weak

"Ok.Not crispy / dry .
",neutral
"lots of the bottles we are busted open and everything was all sticky
",neutral
"I ordered this and the order says it is 3 packs. I only got one. I feel I was ripped off.
",neutral
"I got only 28 out 30. If I pay for 30, well I want 30.
",neutral
"Convenient but but taste is off
",neutral
"Five of the 12 cans arrived dented.
",neutral
"Given the price, I expected a much larger bottle and, quite frankly, felt ripped off.
",neutral
"I like the product
",neutral
"The product is flavorful but had to throw 3 out of 12 cans away because they were damaged.
",neutral
"1 item was broke upon arrival
",neutral
"Too much inflated crust - quite few apples  - Not recommended
",neutral
"Not much difference from the regular. The price is way to high.
",neutral
"Not a lot of flavor
",neutral
"I thought chocolate and chili would be an interesting combo, but I was not impressed.
",neutral
"quite just tastes like your average commercial coffee you could buy in any store.
",neutral
"People rave about this spice, but I personally thought it was too peppery for my coffee
",neutral
"Cans all dented.
",neutral
"I did not know it added sugar
",neutral
"When I got the package, the bars tasted like the plastic that they were wrapped in.
",neutral
"They were not like the ones from my childhood.
",neutral
"Have not eaten yet
",neutral
"A little goes a long way. Too salty if you use too much.
",neutral
"Tastes the same, only smaller than then the originals.  Plus, no red tip.
",neutral
"Not the best flavor and certainly not the worst.
",neutral
"Practically do not feel the lacander there
",neutral
"Those were quite tiny candy packets and not quite fresh. I would not buy again.
",neutral
"quite, quite, sweet and sugary.  quite expensive for what you get.

"Halloween candy trick or treat .
",neutral
"I like the coffee & the convenience of it except the pump was broken.
",neutral
"It says pack of 2 and I only received 1?
",neutral
"Many of the rings had the chocolate flaking off, and the chocolate seemed a little stale.
",neutral
"it does not move all over
",neutral
"Will probably only use to refill my smaller Orbit containers.
",neutral
"Too creamy Not real sherbet
",neutral
"not what I had expected. , flavor is lacking
",neutral
"The flavor was not what I expected. I can do without.
",neutral
"The bag was opened and the candies spilled all over inside the box.
",neutral
"it s not that tasty
",neutral
"probably caffeine boost but the taste.. ehh
",neutral
"we finally opened and unwrapped our salt block to use it, & discouraged that was damaged.
",neutral
"It is just a bland sauce... so much more could have been down to give it flavor with less sugar .
",neutral
"But if you like the flavor of water. Not much flavor. So if you like that this is for you
",neutral
"Tasty but could be tastier
",neutral
"Smaller amount then I thought
",neutral
"Candy was melted inside if wrappers.
",neutral
"I end up liking only one flavor out of them all...
",neutral
"Spendy.  quite no taste to them.  Would not order them again.
",neutral
"I did not like that it was in a plastic bottle.
",neutral
"It is not what I expected, it is average, it is ok.
",neutral
"I like this product but it is more expensive that should. Kroger sells it at $4.39
",neutral
"Tastes ok but not strong enough. It just tastes like black tea.
",neutral
"Ok but seemed stale. Within the date but something seemed off
",neutral
"They are just crackers
",neutral
"Rubbery.  No Taste
",neutral
"It does not taste different compared to normal ketchup.
",neutral
"did not work in Elite Gourmet brewer - plastic melted and coffee grounds sprayed out

"Think they could  do without the carcinogenic  ingredient
",neutral
"""The """"pecan"""" flavor is not noticeable.""
",neutral
"The smell when cooking with is was horrendous.
",neutral
"Two boxes arrived already opened. I refuse to eat food that has been tampered with

"Falsely advertised. Mostly sugar and not naturally flavored.
",neutral
"One of the cookie tins had a big dent in it.
",neutral
"It does not blend , you can feel the grainyness when drinking.
",neutral
"Not bad tasting, just a little sweeter than I would like my mustard to be.
",neutral
"some were melted together but still eatable
",neutral
"Not the tastiest, but passable
",neutral
"Took a long time to get to me. Used it as a beverage.
",neutral
"Do not buy this as a low carb option. It has 12 servings totaling 144 carbs for the pack.
",neutral
"I should have tried  the lite version
",neutral
"Pretty but a little flimsy
",neutral
"i liked it all except the stale cheezits
",neutral
"This is way to spicy for me.
",neutral
"Jar bery too small and get a better deal in  larger jar at costco.
",neutral
"Smaller then anticipated

"so far the tea has not caused me loose weight but i no longer feel bloated
",neutral
"While I like Belvita's in general, I was not a big fan of the chocolate.
",neutral
"These are the perfect size. I was so disappointed because about a third of each can was broken up.
",neutral
"Every can was dented. It did not seem to affect the flavor though. So I did not ask for refund.
",neutral
"You will need to use all of these in a bottle to get the flavor and scent that you need.
",neutral
"too pricey for size.
",neutral
"Expecting 2 pieces for the price paid.
",neutral
"Did not receive any seasoning or recipes as stated.
",neutral
"Misleading size.
",neutral
"There is no list of ingredients on this and no expiration date.
",neutral
"Note to self - Never ever buy anything from prime that will turn to crumbs.
",neutral
"At a dollar a cookie, eat some newspaper or celery instead
",neutral
"I like peach tea but this green peach tea is not for me. Tastes watered down
",neutral
"Truly only a topping. Not as versatile as Frenchs.

"Costco has same product in bigger jar for half the price.  And they seem to be fresher.
",neutral
"Received 25 bars instead of 30
",neutral
"This coffee lacked body and flavor.
",neutral
"Has a slight ash-y taste that I am not fond of. Maybe that is normal for yerba mate?
",neutral
"Arrived dented. Was going to give as gift.
",neutral
"Did not like the texture of the bars
",neutral
"I did not realize these did not have the pull tops- which make it a lot easier.

"The bottle came and the cap to close the oil once you remove the plastic seal gone
",neutral
"Only got two packs that were not in pieces

",neutral
"Mildew in 3 days only ate one
",neutral
"Not as tasty as regular tea, but it is growinv on me.

"Taste not the same. They must have changed something with the Strawberry/Kiwi
",neutral
"Barely any chips in the bag for the cost.
",neutral
"Wish these were organic.
