This honey comb was not of good quality. I chocked on the product. Worse, they do not allow returns.
Maybe it would be good for a rub but definitely NOT chimichurri.
This was so gritty it was inedible. We just trashed it.
It is a good thing there was nothing fragile in the box. Only lost 3 K-cups
The entire packaging was wet when I opened my order.  Inside i found my bottle was leaking.
I was so excited to see these..
you can easily buy this water from dollar tree . $ 1.00 for each GALLON of water .
It is great jam but one of the four jars arrived open with a dent in the lid.
Certainly not hot at all! Very disappointed! Will not be purchasing again!
I really should have known better than to order chocolate. It arrived melted.
It was unuseable. Not chips a melted hunk of carob.
Not sweet at all.
These do not taste anything like the actual drinks.  They are honestly terrible. :(
It was awful. No coffee flavor .And since I could not return it , I gave it to the thrift store.
Tastes sweet!  And funny.  Gave whole case away.
Arrived damaged with empty cans showed pictures and NO RESPONSE !
Taste good but sugar alcohol is not Stevia.
Nothing but salt....no pork flavor at all. Ruined my soup. I would not buy this product.
Cute party favors but the kids did not like the taste of it
Both bags came blotted and not useable. No return policy, so there goes almost 30.00.
Not good tasting at all. Stale and poorly roasted
This was a very small bag for the money
"The sauce is gross, even my two year old who loves all things pasta said ""ew!"""
Also something with Amazons cookies never fresh
Product was damaged when I received it.
Buyer beware. Received item and container seal was open and some missing. Threw it away. :(
Taste old gritty will not be buying them again
I have purchased these before and they were great. This batch tastes stale.
last batch was real sour.....  Is there an issue with quality.
Soup with oatmeal in it yuck!
Tastes like cardboard.  Do not try.
STALE!!  NEED REFUND
This is terrible no flavor
They came stale and horrible tasting
Overpriced!!!!!! 2.99 @ target. I did not realize that I was only paying for one box
My order came in damaged and I cannot return or get a replacement
Barely any popcorn in the box, cannot even return for my money back.  Not worth it
Horrible artificial off butter taste.  Very little pecans, a rip off.
Product arrived after a long time stale and melted.
Would not order again. All taste nasty
When the package came the drops were completely melted together and smushed.
Cost size per pack is not worth it. These are the small sizes and half the bag was filled with AIR
I really wanted to like this...but I just do not.  Flavors just do not go together for me.
Broken seal and product had a gummy texture.
I ordered what was listed as 4 items, only received 1 broken bag of candy.
I did not like the taste at all and threw it out halfway through my first serving.
