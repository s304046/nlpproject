good when you first put it in your mouth last about 3 minutes then it is hard and flavorless
like the taste, dislike the high price.
Second time I have ordered this and both times it was quite scarce on the blue doritos
The corn did have caramel but not like the type I am use to.
Not the same as what I have had in different countries
Sweet. Hard to puncture.
It was not as much as I expected

It was all melted when it came.
I would not order this again
The coffee was alright
Not dry jerky, as one would expect; but quite moist meat. Surprising and disappointing.
Personally did not care for this flavor.
One jar leaked and I think is unusable.
drinking of course.
These are quite good but way too expensive now.  Looking for another brand.
I wanted to try these alternative ingredients, but I did not care for it.
It does not give the coffee the flavor that I taste in the Dubai coffee.
Just trying to figure out what this is?
quite salty, little ranch flavor.
my fault i did not read description of all individual wrapped...
It was a gift. it came on a loose box. wrappers were messed up  Had to rebox it
Ok but a little weak, make a small cup to get better flavor.
Not bad coffee.  I just find that the ground is a little to course for espresso.
Tastes good but quite expensive
Portion size was not a lot, the chips are quite thin with a different texture to them. Tasted okay.
not what I expected
My wife is not a fan.
Offers variety in a price-friendly manner.
Just use a little the salt is too much even if you like salty
It is stove top stuffing, nothing extraordinary nothing bad
need to work with it a little more, hard to judge when batch is ready
these candy bars are smaller than the American-made ones
Overall the product was 3.5 out of 5. It was good, not great.
I am used to another brand
No taste, no scent of coffee
If you do not mind the taste, they are sweetend with sucrose.
Zero carbs my aunt Fannie.  In quite tiny prints *zero carbs minus fiber.

not quite thrilled with the product tasted old
One month expiration date was a shock
Thought it would have the seed in it
Taste bad but its good for you.
Like product but took almost a month.  Jammed in a tiny box.
I could not drink it because of the sugar content..35grams of sugar..and I am diabetic
I like the two way wick.
The box was squished, the cereal was more like quite small crumbled pieces
I could gave bought this at the Acme for $1.00
It had an ok taste but was not sour enough for me. It was not a good value for the money.
Not quite good, have ordered similar product at Amazon Pantry that were much better.
I wish I could have chosen the entree.
It tastes good, but not worth buying. Comes quite little. Too expensive for it.
That it was  edible
The cans were all dented and busted up
Does not give the burning sensation
My concern was that the jar was not sealed. Took a chance and ate one anyways
Tough. Fall apart easily. Edible.

Ok.Not crispy / dry .
lots of the bottles we are busted open and everything was all sticky
I ordered this and the order says it is 3 packs. I only got one. I feel I was ripped off.
I got only 28 out 30. If I pay for 30, well I want 30.
Convenient but but taste is off
Five of the 12 cans arrived dented.
Given the price, I expected a much larger bottle and, quite frankly, felt ripped off.
I like the product
The product is flavorful but had to throw 3 out of 12 cans away because they were damaged.
1 item was broke upon arrival
Too much inflated crust - quite few apples  - Not recommended
Not much difference from the regular. The price is way to high.
Not a lot of flavor
I thought chocolate and chili would be an interesting combo, but I was not impressed.
quite just tastes like your average commercial coffee you could buy in any store.
People rave about this spice, but I personally thought it was too peppery for my coffee
Cans all dented.
I did not know it added sugar
When I got the package, the bars tasted like the plastic that they were wrapped in.
They were not like the ones from my childhood.
Have not eaten yet
A little goes a long way. Too salty if you use too much.
Tastes the same, only smaller than then the originals.  Plus, no red tip.
Not the best flavor and certainly not the worst.
Practically do not feel the lacander there
Those were quite tiny candy packets and not quite fresh. I would not buy again.
quite, quite, sweet and sugary.  quite expensive for what you get.
ok taste. Gritty.  Not nearly as good as Salt Wrap creamer but much cheaper
Halloween candy trick or treat .
I like the coffee & the convenience of it except the pump was broken.
It says pack of 2 and I only received 1?
Many of the rings had the chocolate flaking off, and the chocolate seemed a little stale.

Too creamy Not real sherbet
not what I had expected. , flavor is lacking
The flavor was not what I expected. I can do without.
The bag was opened and the candies spilled all over inside the box.
it s not that tasty
probably caffeine boost but the taste.. ehh
we finally opened and unwrapped our salt block to use it, & discouraged that was damaged.
It is just a bland sauce... so much more could have been down to give it flavor with less sugar .
But if you like the flavor of water. Not much flavor. So if you like that this is for you
Tasty but could be tastier
Smaller amount then I thought
Candy was melted inside if wrappers.
I end up liking only one flavor out of them all...
Spendy.  quite no taste to them.  Would not order them again.
I did not like that it was in a plastic bottle.
It is not what I expected, it is average, it is ok.

Not bad tasting, just a little sweeter than I would like my mustard to be.
some were melted together but still eatable
Not the tastiest, but passable

Do not buy this as a low carb option. It has 12 servings totaling 144 carbs for the pack.
I should have tried  the lite version
Pretty but a little flimsy
i liked it all except the stale cheezits
This is way to spicy for me.

I only recieved one pack.
so far the tea has not caused me loose weight but i no longer feel bloated
While I like Belvita's in general, I was not a big fan of the chocolate.
These are the perfect size. I was so disappointed because about a third of each can was broken up.
Every can was dented. It did not seem to affect the flavor though. So I did not ask for refund.
You will need to use all of these in a bottle to get the flavor and scent that you need.
too pricey for size.
Expecting 2 pieces for the price paid.
Did not receive any seasoning or recipes as stated.
Misleading size.
There is no list of ingredients on this and no expiration date.
Note to self - Never ever buy anything from prime that will turn to crumbs.
At a dollar a cookie, eat some newspaper or celery instead
I like peach tea but this green peach tea is not for me. Tastes watered down
Truly only a topping. Not as versatile as Frenchs.
Costco has same product in bigger jar for half the price.  And they seem to be fresher.
Received 25 bars instead of 30
This coffee lacked body and flavor.
Has a slight ash-y taste that I am not fond of. Maybe that is normal for yerba mate?

I did not realize these did not have the pull tops- which make it a lot easier.
These were quite gummy(almost melted) with a bitter taste.

Some of them were empty just a sticker
Overprced. Watch out . You get one not two
Tiny bones in the meatballs made food inedible.

Too much sodium for no/low sodium diet. 110 mg/2 Tbs which in not enough for average salad.
I used it for a party
Frosting worked well to decorate but did not  care for the taste.

All good but the cost. Way too expensive to order.
Product is fine...terribly over-priced...
A little too mild for my taste.
