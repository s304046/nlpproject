"More than 50% of the cookies were broken. Too loosely packaged.
",neutral

"A few of the flavors are quite strong. The pink salt smells of fish.

"Paid for 24 packs, only got 23.  Seems to be the trend.

"This is a quite average cookie, that quite needs milk to enhance the cookie eating experience.

"Not as big as I wanted. Some were cracked. Live and learn.

",neutral
"Amazon always makes something look a different size than what it quite is.

"quite flat in taste, I was dispointed.
",neutral
"The flavor was ok. Nothing special. I did not like the half hard half mushy texture of the olives.
",neutral
"much smaller than the picture shows.
",neutral
"It was out of date. I did not realize it until I tried chewing a stick of it.
",neutral
"The texture is grainy.  It is not the sugar that is grainy but the candy jelly itself.

"as I expected as my French friends all use it.
",neutral
"Item was as advertised
",neutral
"One bottle was leaking.
",neutral
"The only thing I did not like was the fact that 4 of the 6 cans were dented.
",neutral
"These are not cans.  They are shelf stable cardboard boxes (asceptic packaging).  I prefer cans.
",neutral
"somewhat bland without much bacon flavor
",neutral
"like the candy but no good when they are all broken, only one or two were all in one piece

",neutral
"Like the health, miss the salt.
",neutral
"Chicken tasted good, broccoli was quite bitter and rice was plain. It was ok.

"Taste good...but so many broken pieces and 1/2 nuts.
",neutral
"Product was not high-quality to me.
",neutral
"Taste a bit bland and is far to runny. Not my fav.
",neutral
"a little tough. If you like gas station jerky this is the one for you. Hot gets 2 stars, teriyaki 3
",neutral
"Not spicy .
",neutral
"The flavor of this product did not wow me.
",neutral
"I did not realize that these are not corn husks
",neutral
"They were melted and stuck together when they got there
",neutral
"I tried these, then switched to another brand that used fresher beans.
",neutral
"""Still uses """"soy"""".  So it is like Chinese soy sauce with the amino acids.""
",neutral
"Wow. the coffee is quite strong. It gave me a headache after drinking only half of my cup.
",neutral
"It is fine, not great. Still looking for the organic bean that has the flavor I crave.
",neutral
"I like Jif Almond Butter but this had totally separated and the price was not great either.
",neutral
"Bag is smaller than it seems it should for price
",neutral
"The quality of the tool box was less than I expected but it made a cute Valentine Day gift.

",neutral
"Not too bad. Would prefer something with a more peanut butter flavor to it though

"good but not great.
",neutral
"This bought back my childhood. Only gripe some were out of the packaging.

"These are the bomb.  It probably helps with the stomach illness.  Thanks
",neutral
"Did not like this .
",neutral
"The chocolates had obviously melted and re-formed inside the wrappers.
",neutral
"Liked product but a little expensive.
",neutral
"Tree started and then died

"Large and regular mixed. I keep changing this review as I go through the container.
",neutral
"I like to share these with others
",neutral
"quite tasty but i only got 8 pieces of Bacon which was quite sad because they are so good.
",neutral
"I recommend this but. Delish and filling. I would buy it again
",neutral
"Upon arrival most crackers were broken upon arrival.
",neutral
"My wife likes it though
",neutral
"Weird plastic with a little salt? Bizarrely unflavored for a cheese.
",neutral
"Most pieces were quite sour which tells me that the fruit was not quite ripe

"The bag did not reseal.
",neutral
"Sour.  I prefer sweet.

"quite bitter tasting for a medium roast coffe, would not buy a second time.
",neutral
"Not that spicy but like it
",neutral
"Many of the packets were not full or completely empty

"One of my bottles came open.
",neutral
"Lots of cool snacks but quite a few taste almost the same
",neutral
"Bought the case as a gift. Am told many cookies were broken in package. That is a shame

"It is not true you can buy them directly from Nespresso for $.55.
",neutral
"This product was packed with other items and many kernels were crushed.
",neutral
"quite weak tea, tastes more like green tea.  Going to try a different manufacturer.
",neutral
"The mix is a too sweet. Having to add some milk powder to tame it down.

"Bars fall apart easily,  which makes it hard to eat

"Purchase was as described. Flavor was alright.

"I would get it again
",neutral
"Not much filling
",neutral
"Okay, a little weak, I like Uncle Lee's other Oolong Tea better

"Was this supposed to be vacuum sealed?

"It did not have much of the sour sop flavor

"Box came with 2 missing cookies. Was supposed to be 12 and only recieved 10.

"This is supposed to be bbq sauce? lol But all joking aside. It is quite thin, has a weak bbq taste.
